    "question": "A company uses AWS X-Ray to monitor a serverless application. The components of the application have different request rates. The user interactions and transactions are important to trace, but they are low in volume. The background processes such as application health checks, polling, and connection maintenance generate high volumes of read-only requests.<br><br>Currently, the default X-Ray sampling rules are universal for all requests. Only the first request per second and some additional requests are recorded. This setup is not helping the company review the requests based on service or request type.<br><br>A developer must configure rules to trace requests based on service or request properties.
