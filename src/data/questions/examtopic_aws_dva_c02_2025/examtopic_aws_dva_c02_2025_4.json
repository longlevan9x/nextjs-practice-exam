    "question": "A developer is writing an application that will retrieve sensitive data from a third-party system. The application will format the data into a PDF file. The PDF file could be more than 1 MB. The application will encrypt the data to disk by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The application will decrypt the file when a user requests to download it. The retrieval and formatting portions of the application are complete.<br><br>The developer needs to use the GenerateDataKey API to encrypt the PDF file so that the PDF file can be decrypted later. The developer needs to use an AWS KMS symmetric customer managed key for encryption.<br><br>Which solutions will meet these requirements?",
