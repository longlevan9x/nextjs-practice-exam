Confirmation includes the recipient’s signature or a photo of the package with the recipient. The driver’s handheld device uploads signatures and photos through FTP to a single Amazon EC2 instance. Each handheld device saves a file in a directory based on the signed-in user, and the file name matches the delivery number. The EC2 instance then adds metadata to the file after querying a central database to pull delivery information. The file is then placed in Amazon S3 for archiving.<br><br>As the company expands, drivers report that the system is rejecting connections. The FTP server is having problems because of dropped connections and memory issues in response to these problems, a system engineer schedules a cron task to reboot the EC2 instance every 30 minutes.
