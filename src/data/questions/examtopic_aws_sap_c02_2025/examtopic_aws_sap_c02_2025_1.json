    "question": "A company is running a data-intensive application on AWS. The application runs on a cluster of hundreds of Amazon EC2 instances. A shared file system also runs on several EC2 instances that store 200&nbsp;TB of data. The application reads and modifies the data on the shared file system and generates a report. The job runs once monthly, reads a subset of the files from the shared file system, and takes about 72&nbsp;hours to complete. The compute instances scale in an Auto Scaling group, but the instances that host the shared file system run continuously. The compute and storage instances are all in the same AWS Region.<br>A solutions architect needs to reduce costs by replacing the shared file system instances. The file system must provide high performance access to the needed data for the duration of the 72-hour run.<br>Which solution will provide the LARGEST overall cost reduction while meeting these requirements?",
