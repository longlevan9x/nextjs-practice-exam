    "explanation": "<p>AWS Wavelength combines the high bandwidth and ultralow latency of 5G networks with AWS compute and storage services so that developers can innovate and build a new class of applications.</p><p>Wavelength Zones are AWS infrastructure deployments that embed AWS compute and storage services within telecommunications providers’ data centers at the edge of the 5G network, so application traffic can reach application servers running in Wavelength Zones without leaving the mobile providers’ network. This prevents the latency that would result from multiple hops to the internet and enables customers to take full advantage of 5G networks. Wavelength Zones extend AWS to the 5G edge, delivering a consistent developer experience across multiple 5G networks around the world.

This means that IAM is only used for the authentication of valid IAM entities. All permissions for interacting with your Amazon EKS cluster’s Kubernetes API are managed through the native Kubernetes RBAC system.</p><p>Access to your cluster using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) entities is enabled by the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator#aws-iam-authenticator-for-kubernetes\">AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes</a>, which runs on the Amazon EKS control plane. The authenticator gets its configuration information from the <code>aws-auth</code> <code>ConfigMap</code> (AWS authenticator configuration map).</p><p>The <code>aws-auth</code> <code>ConfigMap</code> is automatically created and applied to your cluster when you create a managed node group or when you create a node group using <code>eksctl</code>. It is initially created to allow nodes to join your cluster, but you also use this <code>ConfigMap</code> to add role-based access control (RBAC) access to IAM users and roles.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Launch the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. Create node groups in Wavelength Zones for the Amazon EKS cluster via the AWS Wavelength service. Apply the AWS authenticator configuration map (</strong><code><strong>aws-auth ConfigMap</strong></code><strong>) to your cluster.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Host the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. Set up node groups in AWS Wavelength Zones for the Amazon EKS cluster. Attach the Amazon EKS connector agent role (</strong><code><strong>AmazonECSConnectorAgentRole</strong></code><strong>) to your cluster and use AWS Control Tower for RBAC access</strong> is incorrect. An Amazon EKS connector agent is only used to connect your externally hosted Kubernetes clusters and to allow them to be viewed in your AWS Management Console. The AWS Control Tower doesn't provide RBAC access too to your EKS cluster. This service is commonly used for setting up a secure multi-account AWS environment and not for providing cluster authentication using IAM users and roles.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Launch the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. Create VPC endpoints for the AWS Wavelength Zones and apply them to the Amazon EKS cluster. Install the AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes (</strong><code><strong>aws-iam-authenticator</strong></code><strong>) to your cluster</strong> is incorrect because you cannot create VPC Endpoints in AWS Wavelength Zones. In addition, it is more appropriate to apply the AWS authenticator configuration map (<code>aws-auth ConfigMap</code>) to your Amazon EKS cluster to enable RBAC access.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Host the application to an Amazon EKS cluster and run the Kubernetes pods on AWS Fargate. Create node groups in AWS Wavelength Zones for the Amazon EKS cluster. Add the EKS pod execution IAM role (</strong><code><strong>AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRole</strong></code><strong>) to your cluster and ensure that the Fargate profile has the same IAM role as your Amazon EC2 node groups</strong> is incorrect. Although this solution is possible, the security configuration of the Amazon EKS control plane is wrong.

    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Cost-Optimized Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Glacier</strong> is a cost-effective archival solution for large amounts of data. Bulk retrievals are S3 Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5 – 12 hours. You can specify an absolute or relative time period (including 0 days) after which the specified Amazon S3 objects should be transitioned to Amazon Glacier.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: <strong>Upload the data to S3 and set a lifecycle policy to transition data to Glacier after </strong><code><strong>0</strong></code><strong> days.</strong></p><p>Glacier has a management console that you can use to create and delete vaults. However, you cannot directly upload archives to Glacier by using the management console. To upload data such as photos, videos, and other documents, you must either use the AWS CLI or write code to make requests by using either the REST API directly or by using the AWS SDKs.</p><p>Take note that uploading data to the S3 Console and setting its storage class of \"Glacier\" is a different story as the proper way to upload data to Glacier is still via its API or CLI. In this way, you can set up your vaults and configure your retrieval options. If you uploaded your data using the S3 console then it will be managed via S3 even though it is internally using a Glacier storage class.</p><p><strong>Uploading the data to S3 then using a lifecycle policy to transfer data to S3-IA</strong> is incorrect because using Glacier would be a more cost-effective solution than using S3-IA. Since the required retrieval period should not exceed more than a day, Glacier would be the best choice.</p><p><strong>Uploading the data to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol</strong> is incorrect because this option costs more than Amazon Glacier, which is more suitable for storing infrequently accessed data. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable file storage that is accessible over the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.</p><p><strong>Uploading the data to S3 then using a lifecycle policy to transfer data to S3 One Zone-IA</strong> is incorrect because with S3 One Zone-IA, the data will only be stored in a single availability zone and thus, this storage solution is not durable.

    "explanation": "<p>A <strong>VPC endpoint</strong> enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an Internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other services does not leave the Amazon network.</p><p>Endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components that allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.</p><p>There are two types of VPC endpoints: <em>interface endpoints</em> and <em>gateway endpoints</em>. You should create the type of VPC endpoint required by the supported service. As a rule of thumb, most AWS services use VPC <em>Interface</em> Endpoint except for S3 and DynamoDB, which use VPC <em>Gateway</em> Endpoint.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3-vpc-endpoint.PNG\"></p><p>There is no additional charge for using gateway endpoints. However, standard charges for data transfer and resource usage still apply.</p><p>Let's assume you created a NAT gateway and you have an EC2 instance routing to the Internet through the NAT gateway. Your EC2 instance behind the NAT gateway sends a 1 GB file to one of your S3 buckets. The EC2 instance, NAT gateway, and S3 Bucket are in the same region US East (Ohio), and the NAT gateway and EC2 instance are in the same availability zone.</p><p>Your cost will be calculated as follows:</p><p><strong>- NAT Gateway Hourly Charge:</strong> NAT Gateway is charged on an hourly basis. For example, the rate is $0.045 per hour in this region.</p><p><strong>- NAT Gateway Data Processing Charge:</strong> 1 GB data went through NAT gateway. The NAT Gateway Data Processing charge is applied and will result in a charge of $0.045.</p><p><strong>- Data Transfer Charge: </strong>This is the standard EC2 Data Transfer charge. 1 GB data was transferred from the EC2 instance to S3 via the NAT gateway. There was no charge for the data transfer from the EC2 instance to S3 as it is Data Transfer Out to Amazon EC2 to S3 in the same region. There was also no charge for the data transfer between the NAT Gateway and the EC2 instance since the traffic stays in the same availability zone using private IP addresses. There will be a data transfer charge between your NAT Gateway and EC2 instance if they are in the different availability zone.</p><p>In summary, your charge will be $0.045 for 1 GB of data processed by the NAT gateway and a charge of $0.045 per hour will always apply once the NAT gateway is provisioned and available. The data transfer has no charge in this example. However, if you send the file to a non-AWS Internet location instead, there will be a data transfer charge as it is data transfer out from Amazon EC2 to the Internet.</p><p>To avoid the NAT Gateway Data Processing charge in this example, you could set up a Gateway Type VPC endpoint and route the traffic to/from S3 through the VPC endpoint instead of going through the NAT Gateway.</p><p>There is no data processing or hourly charges for using Gateway Type VPC endpoints.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: <strong>Remove the NAT instance and create an S3 gateway endpoint to access S3 objects.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Replace the NAT instance with NAT Gateway to access S3 objects</strong> is incorrect. A NAT Gateway is just a NAT instance that is managed for you by AWS. It provides less operational management and you pay for the hour that your NAT Gateway is running. This is not the most effective solution since you will still pay for the idle time.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use a smaller instance type for the NAT instance</strong> is incorrect. Although this might reduce the cost, it still is not the most cost-efficient solution. An S3 Gateway endpoint is still the best solution because it comes with no additional charge.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Remove the NAT instance and create an S3 interface endpoint to access S3 objects</strong> is incorrect. An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet. Unlike a Gateway endpoint, you still get billed for the time your interface endpoint is running and the GB data it has processed. From a cost standpoint, using the S3 Gateway endpoint is the most favorable solution.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p>",

While it's a valid solution, it's a bit of overkill to use AWS Glue for processing 1 MB of data per day.

Step scaling policies increase or decrease the current capacity of a scalable target based on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments. The adjustments vary based on the size of the alarm breach. After a scaling activity is started, the policy continues to respond to additional alarms, even while a scaling activity is in progress. Therefore, all alarms that are breached are evaluated by Application Auto Scaling as it receives the alarm messages.</p><p>When you configure dynamic scaling, you must define how to scale in response to changing demand. For example, you have a web application that currently runs on two instances and you want the CPU utilization of the Auto Scaling group to stay at around 50 percent when the load on the application changes. This gives you extra capacity to handle traffic spikes without maintaining an excessive amount of idle resources. You can configure your Auto Scaling group to scale automatically to meet this need.

However, the solution should still allow specific IP addresses from that country. </p><p>Which combination of steps should the Architect implement to satisfy this requirement? (Select TWO.)</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>If you want to allow or block web requests based on the country that the requests originate from, create one or more geo-match conditions. A geo match condition lists countries that your requests originate from. Later in the process, when you create a web ACL, you specify whether to allow or block requests from those countries.</p><p>You can use geo-match conditions with other <strong>AWS WAF</strong> Classic conditions or rules to build sophisticated filtering. For example, if you want to block certain countries but still allow specific IP addresses from that country, you could create a rule containing a geo match condition and an IP match condition. Configure the rule to block requests that originate from that country and do not match the approved IP addresses. As another example, if you want to prioritize resources for users in a particular country, you could include a geo-match condition in two different rate-based rules. Set a higher rate limit for users in the preferred country and set a lower rate limit for all other users.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/2020-05-18_02-02-15-d61e11a7ef49c4e090a2d3a70b524779.png\"></p><p>If you are using the CloudFront geo restriction feature to block a country from accessing your content, any request from that country is blocked and is not forwarded to AWS WAF Classic. So if you want to allow or block requests based on geography plus other AWS WAF Classic conditions, you should <em>not</em> use the CloudFront geo restriction feature. Instead, you should use an AWS WAF Classic geo match condition.</p><p>Hence, the correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- Using AWS WAF, create a web ACL with a rule that explicitly allows requests from approved IP addresses declared in an IP Set.</strong></p><p><strong>- Add another rule in the AWS WAF web ACL with a geo match condition that blocks requests that originate from a specific country.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>In the Application Load Balancer, create a listener rule that explicitly allows requests from approved IP addresses</strong> is incorrect because a listener rule just checks for connection requests using the protocol and port that you configure. It only determines how the load balancer routes the requests to its registered targets.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up a geo match condition in the Application Load Balancer that block requests that originate from a specific country</strong> is incorrect because you can't configure a geo match condition in an Application Load Balancer. You have to use AWS WAF instead.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Place a Transit Gateway in front of the VPC where the application is hosted and set up Network ACLs that block requests that originate from a specific country</strong> is incorrect because AWS Transit Gateway is simply a service that enables customers to connect their Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and their on-premises networks to a single gateway. Using this type of gateway is not warranted in this scenario. Moreover, Network ACLs are not suitable for blocking requests from a specific country. You have to use AWS WAF instead.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-web-acl-geo-conditions.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-web-acl-geo-conditions.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/how-aws-waf-works.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/how-aws-waf-works.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS WAF Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-waf/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-waf/</a></p>",

You can define the tags on the UAT and production EC2 instances and add a condition to the IAM policy which allows access to specific tags.</p><p>Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.

You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/security-diagram.png\"></p><p>The following are the basic things that you need to know about network ACLs:</p><p>- Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL. By default, it allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, IPv6 traffic.</p><p>- You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.</p><p>- Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL.</p><p>- You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.</p><p>- A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules that we evaluate in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic is allowed in or out of any subnet associated with the network ACL. The highest number that you can use for a rule is 32766. We recommend that you start by creating rules in increments (for example, increments of 10 or 100) so that you can insert new rules where you need to later on.</p><p>- A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic.</p><p>- Network ACLs are stateless; responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).</p><p>The scenario clearly states that it requires the <strong>quickest</strong> way to fix the security vulnerability. In this situation, you can manually block the offending IP addresses using Network ACLs since the IT Security team has already identified the list of offending IP addresses. Alternatively, you can set up a bastion host, however, this option entails additional time to properly set up as you have to configure the security configurations of your bastion host.</p><p>Hence, <strong>blocking the IP addresses in the Network Access Control List</strong> is the best answer since it can quickly resolve the issue by blocking the IP addresses using Network ACL.</p><p><strong>Placing the EC2 instances into private subnets</strong> is incorrect because if you deploy the EC2 instance in the private subnet without a public or EIP address, it would not be accessible over the Internet, even to you.</p><p><strong>Removing the Internet Gateway from the VPC</strong> is incorrect because doing this will also make your EC2 instance inaccessible to you as it will cut down the connection to the Internet.</p><p><strong>Assigning a static Anycast IP address to each EC2 instance</strong> is incorrect because a static Anycast IP address is primarily used by AWS Global Accelerator to enable organizations to route traffic seamlessly to multiple regions and improve availability and performance for their end-users.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ACLs.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ACLs.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Security Group vs. NACL:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/security-group-vs-nacl/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/security-group-vs-nacl/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A leading media company has recently adopted a hybrid cloud architecture which requires them to migrate their application servers and databases in AWS. One of their applications requires a heterogeneous database migration in which you need to transform your on-premises Oracle database to PostgreSQL in AWS. This entails a schema and code transformation before the proper data migration starts.   </p><p>Which of the following options is the most suitable approach to migrate the database in AWS?  </p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>AWS Database Migration Service</strong> helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases.</p><p>AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most of the widely used commercial and open source databases. It supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle to Amazon Aurora. Migrations can be from on-premises databases to Amazon RDS or Amazon EC2, databases running on EC2 to RDS, or vice versa, as well as from one RDS database to another RDS database. It can also move data between SQL, NoSQL, and text based targets.</p><p>In heterogeneous database migrations the source and target databases engines are different, like in the case of Oracle to Amazon Aurora, Oracle to PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server to MySQL migrations. In this case, the schema structure, data types, and database code of source and target databases can be quite different, requiring a schema and code transformation before the data migration starts. That makes heterogeneous migrations a two step process. <strong>First use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to convert the source schema and application code to match that of the target database, and then use the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database</strong>. All the required data type conversions will automatically be done by the AWS Database Migration Service during the migration. The source database can be located in your own premises outside of AWS, running on an Amazon EC2 instance, or it can be an Amazon RDS database. The target can be a database in Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Configure a Launch Template that automatically converts the source schema and code to match that of the target database. Then, use the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database</strong> is incorrect because Launch templates are primarily used in EC2 to enable you to store launch parameters so that you do not have to specify them every time you launch an instance.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use Amazon Neptune to convert the source schema and code to match that of the target database in RDS. Use the AWS Batch to effectively migrate the data from the source database to the target database in a batch process</strong> is incorrect because Amazon Neptune is a fully-managed graph database service and not a suitable service to use to convert the source schema. AWS Batch is not a database migration service and hence, it is not suitable to be used in this scenario. You should use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool and AWS Database Migration Service instead.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Heterogeneous database migration is not supported in AWS. You have to transform your database first to PostgreSQL and then migrate it to RDS</strong> is incorrect because heterogeneous database migration is supported in AWS using the Database Migration Service.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dms/ \">https://aws.amazon.com/dms/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html \">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/batch/\">https://aws.amazon.com/batch/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Database Migration Service Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-database-migration-service/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-database-migration-service/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>An e-commerce application is using a fanout messaging pattern for its order management system. For every order, it sends an Amazon SNS message to an SNS topic, and the message is replicated and pushed to multiple Amazon SQS queues for parallel asynchronous processing. A Spot EC2 instance retrieves the message from each SQS queue and processes the message. There was an incident that while an EC2 instance is currently processing a message, the instance was abruptly terminated, and the processing was not completed in time. </p><p>In this scenario, what happens to the SQS message?</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>A \"fanout\" pattern is when an Amazon SNS message is sent to a topic and then replicated and pushed to multiple Amazon SQS queues, HTTP endpoints, or email addresses. This allows for parallel asynchronous processing. For example, you could develop an application that sends an Amazon SNS message to a topic whenever an order is placed for a product. Then, the Amazon SQS queues that are subscribed to that topic would receive identical notifications for the new order. The Amazon EC2 server instance attached to one of the queues could handle the processing or fulfillment of the order, while the other server instance could be attached to a data warehouse for analysis of all orders received.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/sns-fanout.png\">When a consumer receives and processes a message from a queue, the message remains in the queue. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically delete the message. Because Amazon SQS is a distributed system, there's no guarantee that the consumer actually receives the message (for example, due to a connectivity issue or due to an issue in the consumer application). Thus, the consumer must delete the message from the queue after receiving and processing it.</p><p>Immediately after the message is received, it remains in the queue. To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a <em>visibility timeout</em>, a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>The message will automatically be assigned to the same EC2 instance when it comes back online within or after the visibility timeout</strong> is incorrect because the message will not be automatically assigned to the same EC2 instance once it is abruptly terminated. When the message visibility timeout expires, the message becomes available for processing by other EC2 instances.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>The message is deleted and becomes duplicated in the SQS when the EC2 instance comes online</strong> is incorrect because the message will not be deleted and won't be duplicated in the SQS queue when the EC2 instance comes online.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>The message will be sent to a Dead Letter Queue in AWS DataSync</strong> is incorrect because although the message could be programmatically sent to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), it won't be handled by AWS DataSync but by Amazon SQS instead. AWS DataSync is primarily used to simplify your migration with AWS. It makes it simple and fast to move large amounts of data online between on-premises storage and Amazon S3 or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html\">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-common-scenarios.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-common-scenarios.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon SQS Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-sqs/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-sqs/</a></p>",

A solutions architect needs to suggest a solution that will enable the security team to inspect traffic entering and exiting their VPC.</p><p>Which approach satisfies the requirements?</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>AWS Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall, and intrusion detection and prevention service for your virtual private cloud (VPC). With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses Suricata — an open-source intrusion prevention system (IPS) for stateful inspection.</p><p>The diagram below shows an AWS Network firewall deployed in a single availability zone and traffic flow for a workload in a public subnet:</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/aws-network-firewall-single-az-deployment-diagram.jpg\"></p><p>You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your Amazon VPC traffic in a number of ways, including the following:</p><p>- Pass traffic through only from known AWS service domains or IP address endpoints, such as Amazon S3.</p><p>- Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your applications can access.</p><p>- Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.</p><p>- Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, independent of the port used.</p><p>Therefore, the correct answer is: <strong>Create a firewall using the AWS Network Firewall service at the VPC level then add custom rule groups for inspecting ingress and egress traffic. Update the necessary VPC route tables.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use the Network Access Analyzer service on the application’s VPC for inspecting ingress and egress traffic. Create a new Network Access Scope to filter and analyze all incoming and outgoing requests</strong> is incorrect. Network Access Analyzer is a feature of VPC that reports on unintended access to your AWS resources based on the security and compliance that you set. This service is not capable of performing deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC, unlike AWS Network Firewall.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a firewall at the subnet level using the Amazon Detective service. Inspect the ingress and egress traffic using the VPC Reachability Analyzer</strong> is incorrect because a firewall must be created at the VPC level and not at the subnet level. Moreover, Amazon Detective can't be used to create a firewall. This service just automatically collects log data from your AWS resources to analyze, investigate, and quickly identify the root cause of potential security issues or suspicious activities in your AWS account. For this scenario, you have to use the AWS Network Firewall instead.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Enable Traffic Mirroring on the Network Load Balancer and forward traffic to the instances. Create a traffic mirror filter to inspect the ingress and egress of data that traverses your Amazon VPC </strong>is incorrect as this alone accomplishes nothing. It would make more sense if you redirect the traffic to an EC2 instance where an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is running. Remember that Traffic Mirroring is simply an Amazon VPC feature that you can use to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface. Traffic mirror filters can't inspect the actual packet of the incoming and outgoing traffic.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/deployment-models-for-aws-network-firewall/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/deployment-models-for-aws-network-firewall/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-network-firewall.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-network-firewall.html</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A client is hosting their company website on a cluster of web servers that are behind a public-facing Application Load Balancer (AWS ALB). The client also uses Amazon Route 53 to manage their public DNS.</p><p>How should the client configure the DNS zone apex record to point to the load balancer?</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Route 53's DNS implementation connects user requests to infrastructure running inside (and outside) of Amazon Web Services (AWS). For example, if you have multiple web servers running on EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, Route 53 will route all traffic addressed to your website (e.g. <code>www.tutorialsdojo.com</code>) to the load balancer DNS name (e.g. <code>elbtutorialsdojo123.elb.amazonaws.com</code>).</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/r53-cf-elb.png\">Additionally, Route 53 supports the alias resource record set, which lets you map your <strong>zone apex (</strong>e.g. <code>tutorialsdojo.com</code>) DNS name to your load balancer DNS name. IP addresses associated with Elastic Load Balancing can change at any time due to scaling or software updates. Route 53 responds to each request for an Alias resource record set with one IP address for the load balancer.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Create an A record aliased to the load balancer DNS name.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Creating an A record pointing to the IP address of the load balancer</strong> is incorrect. You should be using an Alias record pointing to the DNS name of the load balancer since the IP address of the load balancer can change at any time.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Creating a CNAME record pointing to the load balancer DNS name</strong> and <strong>creating an alias for CNAME record to the load balancer DNS name</strong> are incorrect because CNAME records cannot be created for your <strong>zone</strong> apex. You should create an alias record at the top node of a DNS namespace which is also known as the <em>zone apex</em>. For example, if you register the DNS name tutorialsdojo.com, the zone apex is tutorialsdojo.com. You can't create a CNAME record directly for tutorialsdojo.com, but you can create an alias record for tutorialsdojo.com that routes traffic to <strong>www</strong>.tutorialsdojo.com.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References</strong>:</p><p><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/setting-up-route53-zoneapex-elb.html\">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/setting-up-route53-zoneapex-elb.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon Route 53 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-route-53/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-route-53/</a></p>",

Users access financial information over the Internet through pre-signed URLs generated by the web application. The company's security team is concerned that internet connectivity to Amazon S3 poses a security risk.</p><p>In this scenario, what will you do to resolve this security vulnerability in the most cost-effective manner?</p>",
    "multiple": false,

    "explanation": "<p>Take note that your VPC lives within a larger AWS network and the services, such as S3, DynamoDB, RDS, and many others, are located outside of your VPC, but still within the AWS network. By default, the connection that your VPC uses to connect to your S3 bucket or any other service traverses the public Internet via your Internet Gateway.</p><p>A <strong>VPC endpoint</strong> enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3-vpc-endpoint.PNG\"></p><p>There are two types of VPC endpoints: <em>interface endpoints</em> and <em>gateway endpoints</em>. You have to create the type of VPC endpoint required by the supported service.</p><p>An <strong>interface endpoint</strong> is an elastic network interface with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service. A <strong>gateway endpoint</strong> is a gateway that is a target for a specified route in your route table, used for traffic destined to a supported AWS service.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/Interface-vs-Gateway-VPC-Endpoint.png\"></p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Change the web architecture to access the financial data through a Gateway VPC Endpoint.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Changing the web architecture to access the financial data in your S3 bucket through a VPN connection</strong> is incorrect because a VPN connection still goes through the public Internet. You have to use a VPC Endpoint in this scenario and not VPN, to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services such as S3.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Changing the web architecture to access the financial data hosted in your S3 bucket by creating a custom VPC endpoint service</strong> is incorrect because a \"VPC endpoint <strong>service</strong>\" is quite different from a \"VPC endpoint\". With the VPC endpoint service, you are the service provider where you can primarily create your own application in your VPC and configure it as an AWS PrivateLink-powered service (referred to as an endpoint service). Other AWS principals can create a connection from their VPC to your endpoint service using an interface VPC endpoint.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Changing the web architecture to access the financial data in S3 through an interface VPC endpoint, which is powered by AWS PrivateLink</strong> is incorrect. Although you can use an Interface VPC Endpoint to satisfy the requirement, this type just entails an associated cost, unlike a Gateway VPC Endpoint. Remember that you won't get billed if you use a Gateway VPC endpoint for your Amazon S3 bucket, unlike an Interface VPC endpoint that is billed for hourly usage and data processing charges.

    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Since the application is scaling up and down multiple times within the hour, the issue lies in the cooldown period of the Auto Scaling group.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/lifecycle_hooks.png\"></p><p>The cooldown period is a configurable setting for your Auto Scaling group that helps to ensure that it doesn't launch or terminate additional instances before the previous scaling activity takes effect. After the Auto Scaling group dynamically scales using a simple scaling policy, it waits for the cooldown period to complete before resuming scaling activities.</p><p>When you manually scale your Auto Scaling group, the default is not to wait for the cooldown period, but you can override the default and honor the cooldown period. If an instance becomes unhealthy, the Auto Scaling group does not wait for the cooldown period to complete before replacing the unhealthy instance.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Change the cooldown period of the Auto Scaling group and set the CloudWatch metric to a higher threshold.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Upgrade the instance type in the launch template</strong> is incorrect because upgrading the instance type could lead to higher costs, which contradicts the goal of optimizing costs. Moreover, it doesn't address the issue of the application scaling up and down multiple times within the hour.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Increase the base number of Auto Scaling instances for the Auto Scaling group</strong> is incorrect because increasing the base number of instances would mean that there are more instances running at all times, even during periods of low demand. This could lead to unnecessary costs if the demand doesn't require that many instances, again contradicting the goal of cost optimization.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Add provisioned IOPS to the instances</strong> is incorrect because it is a feature that allows you to specify a certain number of IOPS for your database. It doesn't directly address the issue of the application scaling up and down frequently.

You can launch Reserved EC2 instances to process the mission-critical data and Spot EC2 instances for processing non-essential batch jobs.</p><p>There are two different charge models for Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS): Fargate Launch Type Model and EC2 Launch Type Model. With Fargate, you pay for the amount of vCPU and memory resources that your containerized application requests while for EC2 launch type model, there is no additional charge. You pay for AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances or EBS volumes) you create to store and run your application.

Application Insights, which is powered by SageMaker and other AWS technologies, provides automated dashboards that show potential problems with monitored applications, which help you to quickly isolate ongoing issues with your applications and infrastructure. The enhanced visibility into the health of your applications that Application Insights provides helps reduce the \"mean time to repair\" (MTTR) to troubleshoot your application issues.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloudwatch-application-insights.png\"></p><p>When you add your applications to Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights, it scans the resources in the applications and recommends and configures metrics and logs on CloudWatch for application components. Example application components include SQL Server backend databases and Microsoft IIS/Web tiers. Application Insights analyzes metric patterns using historical data to detect anomalies and continuously detects errors and exceptions from your application, operating system, and infrastructure logs. It correlates these observations using a combination of classification algorithms and built-in rules. Then, it automatically creates dashboards that show the relevant observations and problem severity information to help you prioritize your actions.</p><p>Elastic Load Balancing provides access logs that capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer. Each log contains information such as the time the request was received, the client's IP address, latencies, request paths, and server responses.

CloudTrail can only track the resource changes made to your ALB, but not the actual IP traffic that goes through it. For this use case, you have to enable the access logs feature instead. In addition, the AWS CloudTrail Lake feature is more suitable for running SQL-based queries on your API events and not for analyzing application traffic.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Install and run the AWS X-Ray daemon on the Amazon ECS cluster.

You can use DataSync to <strong>migrate</strong> active datasets to AWS, archive data to free up on-premises storage capacity, replicate data to AWS for business continuity, or transfer data to the cloud for analysis and processing.</p><p>Both AWS Storage Gateway and AWS DataSync can send data from your on-premises data center to AWS and vice versa. However, AWS Storage Gateway is more suitable to be used in integrating your storage services by replicating your data while AWS DataSync is better for workloads that require you to move or migrate your data.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/Storage+Gateway+vs+DataSync.png\"></p><p>You can also use a combination of DataSync and File Gateway to minimize your on-premises infrastructure while seamlessly connecting on-premises applications to your cloud storage. AWS DataSync enables you to automate and accelerate online data transfers to AWS storage services. File Gateway is a fully managed solution that will automate and accelerate the replication of data between the on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services.</p><p><strong>AWS CloudTrail</strong> is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of your AWS account.

Management events can also include non-API events that occur in your account.</p><p><strong>Data Events</strong>, on the other hand, provide visibility into the resource operations performed on or within a resource. These are also known as data plane operations. It allows granular control of data event logging with advanced event selectors. You can currently log data events on different resource types such as Amazon S3 object-level API activity (e.g. GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject API operations), AWS Lambda function execution activity (the Invoke API), DynamoDB Item actions, and many more.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/cloudtrail-data-events.png\"></p><p>With <strong>S3 Object Lock</strong>, you can store objects using a <em>write-once-read-many</em> (WORM) model. Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. You can use Object Lock to help meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage or to simply add another layer of protection against object changes and deletion.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/CloudTrail_vs_S3_server_access_logs.png\"></p><p>You can record the actions that are taken by users, roles, or AWS services on Amazon S3 resources and maintain log records for auditing and compliance purposes. To do this, you can use server access logging, AWS CloudTrail logging, or a combination of both. AWS recommends that you use AWS CloudTrail for logging bucket and object-level actions for your Amazon S3 resources.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Set up AWS DataSync to move the existing health records from the on-premises network to the AWS Cloud. Launch a new Amazon S3 bucket to store existing and new records. Enable AWS CloudTrail with Data Events and Amazon S3 Object Lock in the bucket.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up AWS Storage Gateway to move the existing health records from the on-premises network to the AWS Cloud. Launch a new Amazon S3 bucket to store existing and new records. Enable AWS CloudTrail with Management Events and Amazon S3 Object Lock in the bucket</strong> is incorrect. The requirement explicitly says that the Solutions Architect must immediately move the existing records to AWS and not integrate or replicate the data. Using AWS DataSync is a more suitable service to use here since the primary objective is to migrate or move data. You also have to use Data Events here and not Management Events in CloudTrail, to properly track all the data access and changes to your objects.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up AWS Storage Gateway to move the existing health records from the on-premises network to the AWS Cloud. Launch an Amazon EBS-backed EC2 instance to store both the existing and new records. Enable Amazon S3 server access logging and S3 Object Lock in the bucket</strong> is incorrect. Just as mentioned in the previous option, using AWS Storage Gateway is not a recommended service to use in this situation since the objective is to move the obsolete data. Moreover, using Amazon EBS to store health records is not a scalable solution compared with Amazon S3. Enabling server access logging can help audit the stored objects. However, it is better to CloudTrail as it provides more granular access control and tracking.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up AWS DataSync to move the existing health records from the on-premises network to the AWS Cloud. Launch a new Amazon S3 bucket to store existing and new records. Enable AWS CloudTrail with Management Events and Amazon S3 Object Lock in the bucket</strong> is incorrect. Although it is right to use AWS DataSync to move the health records, you still have to configure Data Events in AWS CloudTrail and not Management Events. This type of event only provides visibility into management operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account and not the data events that are happening in the individual objects in Amazon S3.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/faqs/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-cloudtrail-provides-more-granular-control-of-data-event-logging/\">https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-cloudtrail-provides-more-granular-control-of-data-event-logging/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS DataSync Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-datasync/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-datasync/</a></p>",

The EC2 instances that consume messages from the SQS queue are configured to poll the queue as often as possible to keep end-to-end throughput as high as possible.

    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>In this scenario, the application is deployed in a fleet of EC2 instances that are polling messages from a single SQS queue. Amazon SQS uses short polling by default, querying only a subset of the servers (based on a weighted random distribution) to determine whether any messages are available for inclusion in the response. Short polling works for scenarios that require higher throughput. However, you can also configure the queue to use Long polling instead, to reduce cost.</p><p>The ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds is the queue attribute that determines whether you are using Short or Long polling. By default, its value is zero which means it is using Short polling. If it is set to a value greater than zero, then it is Long polling.</p><p>Hence, <strong>configuring Amazon SQS to use long polling by setting the ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds to a number greater than zero is the correct answer.</strong></p><p>Quick facts about SQS Long Polling:</p><p>- Long polling helps reduce your cost of using Amazon SQS by reducing the number of empty responses when there are no messages available to return in reply to a <em>ReceiveMessage</em> request sent to an Amazon SQS queue and eliminating false empty responses when messages are available in the queue but aren't included in the response.</p><p>- Long polling reduces the number of empty responses by allowing Amazon SQS to wait until a message is available in the queue before sending a response. Unless the connection times out, the response to the <code>ReceiveMessage</code> request contains at least one of the available messages, up to the maximum number of messages specified in the <code>ReceiveMessage</code> action.</p><p>- Long polling eliminates false empty responses by querying all (rather than a limited number) of the servers. Long polling returns messages as soon any message becomes available.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reference:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon SQS Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-sqs/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-sqs/</a></p>",

Each S3 prefix can support these request rates, making it simple to increase performance significantly.</p><p>Applications running on Amazon S3 today will enjoy this performance improvement with no changes, and customers building new applications on S3 do not have to make any application customizations to achieve this performance. Amazon S3's support for parallel requests means you can scale your S3 performance by the factor of your compute cluster without making any customizations to your application. Performance scales per prefix, so you can use as many prefixes as you need in parallel to achieve the required throughput.

That means you can now use logical or sequential naming patterns in S3 object naming without any performance implications. This improvement is now available in all AWS Regions.</p><p><strong>Using Byte-Range Fetches to retrieve multiple ranges of an object data per GET request</strong> is incorrect. Although a Byte-Range Fetch helps you achieve higher aggregate throughput, Amazon S3 does <strong>not</strong> support retrieving multiple ranges of data per GET request. Using the Range HTTP header in a GET Object request, you can fetch a byte range from an object, transferring only the specified portion. You can use concurrent connections to Amazon S3 to fetch different byte ranges from within the same object. Fetching smaller ranges of a large object also allows your application to improve retry times when requests are interrupted.</p><p><strong>Adding a random prefix to the key names</strong> is incorrect. Adding a random prefix is not required in this scenario because S3 can now scale automatically to adjust performance. You do not need to add a random prefix anymore for this purpose since S3 has increased performance to support at least 3,500 requests per second to add data and 5,500 requests per second to retrieve data, which covers the workload in the scenario.</p><p><strong>Using a predictable naming scheme in the key names such as sequential numbers or date time sequences</strong> is incorrect because Amazon S3 already maintains an index of object key names in each AWS region. S3 stores key names in alphabetical order. The key name dictates which partition the key is stored in. Using a sequential prefix increases the likelihood that Amazon S3 will target a specific partition for a large number of your keys, overwhelming the I/O capacity of the partition.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AmazonS3BestPractices.pdf\">https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AmazonS3BestPractices.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/GettingObjectsUsingAPIs.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/GettingObjectsUsingAPIs.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A company has a web application hosted in their on-premises infrastructure that they want to migrate to AWS cloud. Your manager has instructed you to ensure that there is no downtime while the migration process is on-going. In order to achieve this, your team decided to divert 50% of the traffic to the new application in AWS and the other 50% to the application hosted in their on-premises infrastructure. Once the migration is over and the application works with no issues, a full diversion to AWS will be implemented. The company's VPC is connected to its on-premises network via an AWS Direct Connect connection.</p><p>Which of the following are the possible solutions that you can implement to satisfy the above requirement? (Select TWO.)</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Application Load Balancers support Weighted Target Groups routing. With this feature, you will be able to do weighted routing of the traffic forwarded by a rule to multiple target groups. This enables various use cases like blue-green, canary, and hybrid deployments without the need for multiple load balancers. It even enables zero-downtime migration between on-premises and cloud or between different compute types like EC2 and Lambda.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/2019-10-06_17-27-58.png\"></p><p>To divert 50% of the traffic to the new application in AWS and the other 50% to the application, you can also use Route 53 with Weighted routing policy. This will divert the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted applications accordingly.</p><p>Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (tutorialsdojo.com) or subdomain name (portal.tutorialsdojo.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of software. You can set a specific percentage of how much traffic will be allocated to the resource by specifying the weights.</p><p>For example, if you want to send a tiny portion of your traffic to one resource and the rest to another resource, you might specify weights of 1 and 255. The resource with a weight of 1 gets 1/256th of the traffic (1/1+255), and the other resource gets 255/256ths (255/1+255).</p><p>You can gradually change the balance by changing the weights. If you want to stop sending traffic to a resource, you can change the weight for that record to 0.</p><p>When you create a target group in your Application Load Balancer, you specify its target type. This determines the type of target you specify when registering with this target group. You can select the following target types:</p><p>1. <strong>instance</strong> - The targets are specified by instance ID.<br>2. <strong>ip</strong> - The targets are IP addresses.<br>3. <strong>Lambda</strong> - The target is a Lambda function.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/alb_add_ip_targets_2.png\"></p><p>When the target type is <strong>ip</strong>, you can specify IP addresses from one of the following CIDR blocks:</p><p>- <code>10.0.0.0/8</code> (RFC 1918)<br>- <code>100.64.0.0/10</code> (RFC 6598)<br>- <code>172.16.0.0/12</code> (RFC 1918)<br>- <code>192.168.0.0/16</code> (RFC 1918)<br>- The subnets of the VPC for the target group</p><p>These supported CIDR blocks enable you to register the following with a target group: ClassicLink instances, instances in a VPC that is peered to the load balancer VPC, AWS resources that are addressable by IP address and port (for example, databases), and on-premises resources linked to AWS through AWS Direct Connect or a VPN connection.</p><p>Take note that you can not specify publicly routable IP addresses. If you specify targets using an instance ID, traffic is routed to instances using the primary private IP address specified in the primary network interface for the instance. If you specify targets using IP addresses, you can route traffic to an instance using any private IP address from one or more network interfaces. This enables multiple applications on an instance to use the same port. Each network interface can have its own security group.</p><p>Hence, the correct answers are the following options:</p><p><strong>- Use an Application Elastic Load balancer with Weighted Target Groups to divert and proportion the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application. Divert 50% of the traffic to the new application in AWS and the other 50% to the application hosted in their on-premises infrastructure.</strong></p><p><strong>- Use Route 53 with Weighted routing policy to divert the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application. Divert 50% of the traffic to the new application in AWS and the other 50% to the application hosted in their on-premises infrastructure.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use a Network Load balancer with Weighted Target Groups to divert the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application. Divert 50% of the traffic to the new application in AWS and the other 50% to the application hosted in their on-premises infrastructure</strong> is incorrect because a Network Load balancer doesn't have Weighted Target Groups to divert the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use Route 53 with Failover routing policy to divert and proportion the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application. Divert 50% of the traffic to the new application in AWS and the other 50% to the application hosted in their on-premises infrastructure</strong> is incorrect because you cannot divert and proportion the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application using Route 53 with Failover routing policy. This is primarily used if you want to configure active-passive failover to your application architecture.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use AWS Global Accelerator to divert and proportion the HTTP and HTTPS traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application. Ensure that the on-premises network has an AnyCast static IP address and is connected to your VPC via a Direct Connect Gateway</strong> is incorrect. Although you can control the proportion of traffic directed to each endpoint using AWS Global Accelerator by assigning weights across the endpoints, it is still wrong to use a Direct Connect Gateway and an AnyCast IP address since these are not required at all. You can only associate static IP addresses provided by AWS Global Accelerator to regional AWS resources or endpoints, such as Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, EC2 Instances, and Elastic IP addresses. Take note that a Direct Connect Gateway, per se, doesn't establish a connection from your on-premises network to your Amazon VPCs. It simply enables you to use your AWS Direct Connect connection to connect to two or more VPCs that are located in different AWS Regions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html\">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-simplifies-deployment-with-weighted-target-groups/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-simplifies-deployment-with-weighted-target-groups/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon Route 53 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-route-53/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-route-53/</a></p>",

You can use the fleet management features of EC2 Auto Scaling to maintain the health and availability of your fleet. You can also use the dynamic and predictive scaling features of EC2 Auto Scaling to add or remove EC2 instances. Dynamic scaling responds to changing demand and predictive scaling automatically schedules the right number of EC2 instances based on predicted demand.

    "question": "<p>A company has several microservices that send messages to an Amazon SQS queue and a backend application that poll the queue to process the messages. The company also has a Service Level Agreement (SLA) which defines the acceptable amount of time that can elapse from the point when the messages are received until a response is sent. The backend operations are I/O-intensive as the number of messages is constantly growing, causing the company to miss its SLA. The Solutions Architect must implement a new architecture that improves the application's processing time and load management.</p><p>Which of the following is the MOST effective solution that can satisfy the given requirement?</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</strong> is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message-oriented middleware and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/AWS-SQS-AgeOfOldestMessage.png\"></p><p>The <code>ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage</code> metric is useful when applications have time-sensitive messages and you need to ensure that messages are processed within a specific time period. You can use this metric to set Amazon CloudWatch alarms that issue alerts when messages remain in the queue for extended periods of time. You can also use alerts to take action, such as increasing the number of consumers to process messages more quickly.</p><p>With a target tracking scaling policy, you can scale (increase or decrease capacity) a resource based on a target value for a specific CloudWatch metric. To create a custom metric for this policy, you need to use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs. Take note that you need to create an AMI from the instance first before you can create an Auto Scaling group to scale the instances based on the <code>ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage</code> metric.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Create an AMI of the backend application's EC2 instance. Use the image to set up an Auto Scaling Group and configure a target tracking scaling policy based on the </strong><code><strong>ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage</strong></code><strong> metric.<br></strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Create an AMI of the backend application's EC2 instance. Use the image to set up an Auto Scaling Group and configure a target tracking scaling policy based on the </strong><code><strong>CPUUtilization</strong></code><strong> metric with a target value of 80% </strong>is incorrect. Although this will improve the backend processing, the scaling policy based on the <code>CPUUtilization</code> metric is not meant for time-sensitive messages where you need to ensure that the messages are processed within a specific time period. It will only trigger the scale-out activities based on the CPU Utilization of the current instances, and not based on the age of the message, which is a crucial factor in meeting the SLA. To satisfy the requirement in the scenario, you should use the <code>ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage</code> metric.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Create an AMI of the backend application's EC2 instance and replace it with a larger instance size </strong>is incorrect because replacing the instance with a large size won't be enough to dynamically handle workloads at any level. You need to implement an Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the capacity of your computing resources.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Create an AMI of the backend application's EC2 instance and launch it to a cluster placement group </strong>is incorrect because a cluster placement group is just a logical grouping of EC2 instances. Instead of launching the instance in a placement group, you must set up an Auto Scaling group for your EC2 instances and configure a target tracking scaling policy based on the <code>ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage</code> metric.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/08/new-amazon-cloudwatch-metric-for-amazon-sqs-monitors-the-age-of-the-oldest-message/\">https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/08/new-amazon-cloudwatch-metric-for-amazon-sqs-monitors-the-age-of-the-oldest-message/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-available-cloudwatch-metrics.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-available-cloudwatch-metrics.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon SQS Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-sqs/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-sqs/</a></p>",

Associate this rule to the Application Load Balancers.</strong> In AWS WAF, you can use the Geographic match rule statement to block access to your site from specific countries or to allow access only from specific countries.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Update the route tables to forward all outbound traffic to AWS Network Firewall and configure a stateful domain list rule group to block the specified country </strong>is incorrect. Domain List Rules block HTTP or HTTPS traffic to domains identified as low-reputation, or that are known or suspected to be associated with malware or botnets. This can't be used to block a particular country.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Update the Network Access Control Lists of all subnets used by the Amazon EC2 instances to “deny” all IP addresses from the specific country</strong> is incorrect. The EC2 instances are behind the Application Load Balancers, thus, if you need to modify NACL for incoming requests you should modify the ALB subnet NACLs.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Update the Network Access Control Lists of all subnets used by the Application Load Balancers to “deny” all IP addresses from the specific country</strong> is incorrect. This may be possible, however, this is not recommended as there will be a lot of IP addresses assigned to a country. The IP addresses list may also change regularly which is difficult to track.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/waf-allow-block-country-geolocation/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/waf-allow-block-country-geolocation/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-geo-match.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-geo-match.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS WAF Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-waf/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-waf/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A company has multiple research departments that have deployed several resources to the AWS cloud. Each department is free to provision resources as needed. To ensure normal operations, the company wants to track its AWS resource usage so that it does not reach the AWS service quotas unexpectedly.</p><p>Which combination of actions should the Solutions Architect implement to meet the company requirements?

    "explanation": "<p><strong>AWS Trusted Advisor</strong> draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers. Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps. If you have a Basic or Developer Support plan, you can use the Trusted Advisor console to access all checks in the Service Limits category and six checks in the Security category.</p><p>AWS has an example of the implementation of the Quota Monitor CloudFormation template that you can deploy on your AWS account. The template uses an AWS Lambda function that runs once every 24 hours. The Lambda function refreshes the AWS Trusted Advisor Service Limits checks to retrieve the most current utilization and quota data through API calls. Amazon EventBridge captures the status events from Trusted Advisor. It uses a set of EventBridge rules to send the status events to all the targets you choose during the initial deployment of the solution: an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic, or a Lambda function for Slack notifications.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/td-quota-monitor-architecture-diagram-example-01-08-25.png\"></p><p>The AWS Trusted Advisor Service limit publishes service limits metric to CloudWatch; thus, you can configure an alarm and send a notification to Amazon SNS. You can also create an AWS Lambda function to read data from specific Trusted Advisor checks. A Lambda function invocation can be scheduled using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to automate the process.</p><p>Hence, the following options are correct:</p><p><strong>- Capture the events using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) and use an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as the target for notifications</strong></p><p><strong>- Write an AWS Lambda function that refreshes the AWS Trusted Advisor Service Limits checks and set it to run every 24 hours</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic and configure it as a target for notifications</strong> is incorrect. This option is incomplete as it doesn't specify where the notification comes from, such as from EventBridge, Lambda functions, etc.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Query the AWS Trusted Advisor Service Limits check every 24 hours by calling the </strong><code><strong>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks</strong></code><strong> API operation. Ensure that your AWS account has a Developer support plan </strong>is incorrect. This API only returns information about all available AWS Trusted Advisor checks, so it will be difficult to extract only \"service limits\" information from this API call. Moreover, the Trusted Advisor APIs (AWS Support APIs) are only available for Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plans.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Utilize the AWS managed rule on AWS Config to monitor AWS resource service quotas. Schedule this checking using an AWS Lambda function</strong> is incorrect because AWS Config rules are primarily designed for compliance purposes rather than for real-time monitoring of quota usage. Additionally, depending on AWS Config adds both costs and complexity, as it requires a separate service to schedule and trigger these checks.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/quota-monitor/\">https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/quota-monitor/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/monitoring-service-limits-with-trusted-advisor-and-amazon-cloudwatch/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/monitoring-service-limits-with-trusted-advisor-and-amazon-cloudwatch/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out these Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Trusted Advisor Cheat Sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloudwatch/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloudwatch/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-trusted-advisor/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-trusted-advisor/</a></p>",

Currently, the software runs on a local server with limited resources, taking several hours to complete each simulation. The server has 32 virtual CPUs (vCPUs) and 256 GiB of memory.

    "explanation": "<p><strong>AWS Batch</strong> is a powerful tool for developers, scientists, and engineers who need to run a large number of batch and ML computing jobs. By optimizing compute resources, AWS Batch enables you to focus on analyzing outcomes and resolving issues, rather than worrying about the technical details of running jobs.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/aws-batch-06-18-23.png\"></p><p>With AWS Batch, you can define and submit multiple simulation jobs to be executed concurrently. AWS Batch will take care of distributing the workload across multiple EC2 instances, scaling up or down based on the demand, and managing the execution environment. It provides an easy-to-use interface and automation for managing the simulations, allowing you to focus on the software itself rather than the underlying infrastructure.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Utilize AWS Batch to manage the execution of the software.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Consider using Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to run the simulations </strong>is incorrect. Spot Instances are not guaranteed to be available at all times. AWS may interrupt the usage of Spot Instances if the spot price exceeds your bid. This can potentially impact the simulations that are running.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use Lambda functions to process simulation tasks in parallel </strong>is incorrect.<strong> </strong>If you need to perform complex simulations that require significant computational power and longer execution times, AWS Lambda functions is not the best solution. While they work well for event-driven and short-lived tasks, Lambda functions have limitations on execution duration that could prevent you from completing simulations within your desired timeframe.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Run the simulations using AWS Fargate </strong>is incorrect. For complex jobs, this approach might not be enough because of the limited processing power that can be allocated to a Fargate task. Moreover, AWS Fargate doesn't have its own system to manage tasks and timing, so you would need to use another system for this, which creates more work.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/batch/\">https://aws.amazon.com/batch/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Checkout this AWS Batch Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-batch/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-batch/</a></p>",

    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>The Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of Pods in a deployment, replication controller, or replica set based on that resource's CPU utilization. This can help your applications scale out to meet increased demand or scale in when resources are not needed, thus freeing up your nodes for other applications. When you set a target CPU utilization percentage, the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler scales your application in or out to try to meet that target.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/horizontal-pad-autoscaler-072623-0703PM.png\"></p><p>Autoscaling is a function that automatically scales your resources up or down to meet changing demands. This is a major Kubernetes function that would otherwise require extensive human resources to perform manually.</p><p>Amazon EKS supports two autoscaling products:</p><p>- Karpenter</p><p>- Cluster Autoscaler</p><p>The Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler automatically adjusts the number of nodes in your cluster when pods fail or are rescheduled onto other nodes. The Cluster Autoscaler uses Auto Scaling groups.<br><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/eks-072623-0752pm.png\"></p><p>Karpenter is a flexible, high-performance Kubernetes cluster autoscaler that launches appropriately sized compute resources, like Amazon EC2 instances, in response to changing application load. It integrates with AWS to provision compute resources that precisely match workload requirements.</p><p>Hence, the correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- Install the Kubernetes Metrics Server to the Amazon EKS cluster and activate the Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.</strong></p><p><strong>- Set up Karpenter to automatically adjusts the number of nodes in the EKS cluster when pods fail or are rescheduled onto other nodes.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Install the Kubernetes Metrics Server to the Amazon EKS cluster and activate Vertical Pod Autoscaler </strong>is incorrect. The scenario in the given question explicitly mentions \"scale in and out,\" which is associated with horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling (scale up and down) is not relevant here. The correct approach should primarily focus on horizontal scaling solutions like Amazon EKS Cluster AutoScaler and Amazon EKS Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to handle automatic scaling of both the underlying infrastructure (nodes) and application pods based on demand.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use CloudWatch Alarms to trigger scaling for containerized applications</strong> is incorrect. Although this approach adds some level of automation, it lacks the dynamic response required to handle rapidly changing traffic patterns. The delay between the alarm trigger and the scaling action could only lead to performance issues during traffic surges.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Enable the Cluster Autoscaler for Amazon EKS to automatically manage the number of nodes based on the resource needs of the pods</strong> is incorrect. The Cluster Autoscaler is a native Kubernetes tool for scaling the number of nodes in an EKS cluster. While it does help manage node resources, it is generally slower to respond to changes in demand compared to Karpenter, and it may require more manual configuration and tuning. Karpenter optimizes node utilization by dynamically selecting instance types and provisioning them based on workload requirements, thus reducing operational overhead. Cluster Autoscaler, while effective, may not reduce operational overhead to the same extent, especially when compared with the automatic and responsive nature of Karpenter.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/autoscaling.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/autoscaling.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon EKS Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-eks/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-eks/</a></p>",
