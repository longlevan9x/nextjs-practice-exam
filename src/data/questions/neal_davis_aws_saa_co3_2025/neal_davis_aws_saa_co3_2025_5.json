AWS Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations. You can use AWS Config to review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines. In this scenario, AWS Config can be utilized to identify all resources that lack proper tags.</p><p><strong>Tagging</strong>: Tags can be added to AWS resources programmatically. By tagging resources, you organize them into groups and subgroups, which can be based on purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. In this context, tagging resources allows AWS Backup to identify and group resources that need to be backed up.</p><p><strong>AWS Backup</strong>: AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate the back up of data across AWS services. You can use AWS Backup to protect several AWS resource types, including Amazon EBS volumes, Amazon RDS databases, Amazon DynamoDB tables, Amazon EFS file systems, and AWS Storage Gateway volumes. It offers a centralized dashboard where you can manage all backups and allows you to automate and monitor backups across AWS services using policies.</p><p>With AWS Config identifying and tagging untagged resources, and AWS Backup automating the backup of tagged resources, this solution requires minimal operational overhead while ensuring all resources are adequately backed up.</p><p><strong>CORRECT: </strong>\"Use AWS Config to identify all untagged resources and tag them programmatically.
