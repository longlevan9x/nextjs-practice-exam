It ensures cost-effective performance improvement for customers in Asia and South America without requiring infrastructure duplication in multiple Regions.</p><p><strong>Establish an AWS Direct Connect connection with a public virtual interface (VIF) from each international customer's data center to the eu-west-1 Region. Route API requests over the Direct Connect connection to the shipment tracking system:</strong> This is incorrect because Direct Connect requires significant investment in physical infrastructure and is more suitable for consistent, high-bandwidth traffic rather than improving API latency for multiple international customers.</p><p><strong>Deploy Amazon CloudFront in front of the API. Configure the API response to be cached and use the CachingOptimized managed policy to improve efficiency and reduce latency for frequently requested data:</strong> This is incorrect because CloudFront is ideal for caching static or frequently accessed content.

The user pool alone does not provide direct access to AWS resources, so the identity pool integrates with the user pool to securely grant users permissions to interact with S3.</p><p><strong>Enable Amazon S3 VPC endpoints in the VPC to ensure private connectivity between the application and the S3 bucket:</strong> This is correct because the application runs in a private subnet and needs secure connectivity to Amazon S3. A VPC endpoint ensures traffic remains within the AWS network, improving security and reducing reliance on internet gateways or NAT gateways.</p><p><strong>Add a bucket policy to deny requests that do not include valid Amazon Cognito credentials:</strong> This is incorrect because bucket policies can restrict access based on certain conditions, but integrating Amazon Cognito requires granting access through IAM roles tied to identity pools, not bucket policies.</p><p><strong>Assign IAM roles directly to the S3 bucket to allow user-level access:</strong> This is incorrect because IAM roles are assigned to entities like users or identity pools, not to resources like S3 buckets. The proper method involves attaching policies to the identity pool role to grant temporary credentials.</p><p><strong>Configure the application to generate Amazon S3 access tokens directly from the Cognito user pool:</strong> This is incorrect because user pools authenticate users but do not directly provide credentials for AWS services.
