Provision an AWS VPN initially and order a Direct Connect link\" is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Provision an AWS Direct Connect connection and migrate the data over the link\" is incorrect due to the lead time for installation.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Launch a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) and migrate the data over the AWS VPN\" is incorrect. A VPG is the AWS-side of an AWS VPN. A VPN does not provide a private connection and is not reliable as you can never guarantee the latency over the Internet</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Provision an AWS VPN CloudHub connection and migrate the data over redundant links\" is incorrect. AWS VPN CloudHub is a service for connecting multiple sites into your VPC over VPN connections. It is not used for aggregating links and the limitations of Internet bandwidth from the company where the data is stored will still be an issue. It also uses the public Internet so is not a private or reliable connection.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/\">https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/\">https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/</a></p><p><strong>Save time with our AWS cheat sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://digitalcloud.training/aws-direct-connect/\">https://digitalcloud.training/aws-direct-connect/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://digitalcloud.training/aws-migration-services/\">https://digitalcloud.training/aws-migration-services/</a></p>",
