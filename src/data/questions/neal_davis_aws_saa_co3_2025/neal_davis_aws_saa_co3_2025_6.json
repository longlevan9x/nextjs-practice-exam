ElastiCache for Redis complements S3 in the following ways:</p><p>- Redis stores data in-memory, so it provides sub-millisecond latency and supports incredibly high requests per second.</p><p>- It supports key/value based operations that map well to S3 operations (for example, GET/SET =&gt; GET/PUT), making it easy to write code for both S3 and ElastiCache.</p><p>- It can be implemented as an application side cache.
