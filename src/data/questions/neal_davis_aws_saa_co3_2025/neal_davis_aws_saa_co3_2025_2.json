    "explanation": "<p>Processing each part using a separate ECS task may not be essential but means you can separate the processing of the data. An Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is used for decoupling applications. It is a message queue on which you place messages for processing by application components. In this case you can process each data processing part in separate ECS tasks and have them write an Amazon SQS queue. That way the backend can pick up the messages from the queue when they’re ready and there is no delay due to the second part not being complete.</p><p><strong>CORRECT: </strong>\"Process each part using a separate ECS task. Create an Amazon SQS queue\" is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Process both parts using the same ECS task. Create an Amazon Kinesis Firehose stream\" is incorrect. Amazon Kinesis Firehose is used for streaming data. This is not an example of streaming data. In this case SQS is better as a message can be placed on a queue to indicate that the job is complete and ready to be picked up by the backend application component.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Process each part using a separate ECS task. Create an Amazon SNS topic and send a notification when the processing completes\" is incorrect. Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) can be used for sending notifications. It is useful when you need to notify multiple AWS services. In this case an Amazon SQS queue is a better solution as there is no mention of multiple AWS services and this is an ideal use case for SQS.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Create an Amazon DynamoDB table and save the output of the first part to the table\" is incorrect. Amazon DynamoDB is unlikely to be a good solution for this requirement. There is a limit on the maximum amount of data that you can store in an entry in a DynamoDB table.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-solutions-architect-associate/application-integration/amazon-sqs/\">https://digitalcloud.training/aws-application-integration-services/</a></p><p><strong>Save time with our AWS cheat sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://digitalcloud.training/aws-application-integration-services/\">https://digitalcloud.training/aws-application-integration-services/</a></p>",

This solution involves more implementation effort compared to using managed AWS services like CloudFront and S3 Transfer Acceleration.</p><p><strong>Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin to accelerate downloads. Use CloudFront for uploads as well. Create additional S3 buckets in multiple Regions and set up replication rules to sync user content between buckets. Redirect users to the closest bucket for downloads:</strong> This is incorrect because adding multiple S3 buckets and setting up replication rules increases the complexity of the solution. While CloudFront can accelerate uploads and downloads, replicating buckets adds unnecessary operational overhead when S3 Transfer Acceleration can address upload latency more efficiently.</p><p><strong>Set up AWS Global Accelerator for the S3 bucket to optimize network routing. Configure the platform to use the Global Accelerator endpoint instead of the S3 bucket:</strong> This is incorrect because AWS Global Accelerator does not directly support S3 buckets as an endpoint. Configuring Global Accelerator would require additional infrastructure, such as custom endpoints, increasing the effort and complexity without directly solving the latency issues.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transfer-acceleration.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transfer-acceleration.html</a></p><p><strong>Save time with our AWS cheat sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://digitalcloud.training/amazon-cloudfront/\">https://digitalcloud.training/amazon-cloudfront/</a></p>",

Use the SQS ApproximateNumberOfMessages metric to dynamically scale the tier based on queue length:</strong> This is correct because target tracking policies allow Auto Scaling to dynamically adjust the number of processing tier instances based on real-time conditions. Using the ApproximateNumberOfMessages attribute from SQS ensures that the application can handle the increasing workload when the queue length grows, preventing CPU exhaustion and processing delays.</p><p><strong>Use predictive scaling in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to add instances to the processing tier ahead of peak times. Use CPU utilization as the key metric to scale:</strong> This is incorrect because predictive scaling may not work well with unpredictable traffic patterns.

Use a scheduled scaling policy for the processing tier instances:</strong> This is incorrect because DynamoDB is not the bottleneck in this scenario. The issue lies in the processing tier's inability to handle the workload, not in the storage tier. Scheduled scaling also does not address the unpredictable nature of traffic peaks.</p><p><strong>Implement an Amazon CloudFront distribution to cache static content in the web tier. Use HTTP request count as a scaling metric for the processing tier:</strong> This is incorrect because the problem is not related to static content delivery or HTTP request volume in the web tier.

Deploy the tables in on-demand capacity mode to handle workload variability:</strong> This is correct because DynamoDB global tables provide automatic multi-Region replication, ensuring low latency and high availability for a global user base. On-demand capacity mode is a cost-effective choice for workloads with unpredictable demand, as it adjusts capacity based on usage.</p><p><strong>Deploy DynamoDB tables in a single AWS Region using provisioned capacity mode. Use DynamoDB Streams to replicate data asynchronously to a secondary Region for failover:</strong> This is incorrect because using DynamoDB Streams for cross-Region replication requires a custom implementation, which increases operational overhead.

Use AWS Lambda to perform real-time data updates for the application:</strong> This is incorrect because S3 is not designed for transactional, low latency use cases like a social media platform.

Deploy DynamoDB tables in a single Region and use manual Cross-Region Replication to replicate data to other Regions for fault tolerance:</strong> This is incorrect because DAX reduces read latency but does not provide global availability or automatic replication.

Setting up RDS for this use case introduces unnecessary complexity.</p><p><strong>Create a custom Lambda function to fetch security data in JSON format and store it in Amazon S3 for further analysis</strong>: While possible, this solution requires custom development and ongoing maintenance, making it less efficient than using a managed service like Amazon Security Lake.</p><p><strong>References:</strong><br><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/security-lake\">https://aws.amazon.com/security-lake</a><br><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/what-is-security-lake.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/what-is-security-lake.html</a></p>",
