    "question": "<p>A company hosted a web application in an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances. The IT manager is concerned about the over-provisioning of the resources that can cause higher operating costs. A Solutions Architect has been instructed to create a cost-effective solution without affecting the performance of the application.</p><p>Which dynamic scaling policy should be used to satisfy this requirement?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Cost-Optimized Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>An <strong>Auto Scaling group</strong> contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies. Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service. The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.</p><p>Step scaling policies and simple scaling policies are two of the dynamic scaling options available for you to use. Both require you to create CloudWatch alarms for the scaling policies. Both require you to specify the high and low thresholds for the alarms. Both require you to define whether to add or remove instances, and how many, or set the group to an exact size. The main difference between the policy types is the step adjustments that you get with step scaling policies. When step adjustments are applied, and they increase or decrease the current capacity of your Auto Scaling group, the adjustments vary based on the size of the alarm breach.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/as-basic-diagram.png\"></p><p>The primary issue with simple scaling is that after a scaling activity is started, the policy must wait for the scaling activity or health check replacement to complete and the cooldown period to expire before responding to additional alarms. Cooldown periods help to prevent the initiation of additional scaling activities before the effects of previous activities are visible.</p><p>With a target tracking scaling policy, you can increase or decrease the current capacity of the group based on a target value for a specific metric. This policy will help resolve the over-provisioning of your resources. The scaling policy adds or removes capacity as required to keep the metric at, or close to, the specified target value. In addition to keeping the metric close to the target value, a target tracking scaling policy also adjusts to changes in the metric due to a changing load pattern.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is:<strong> Use target tracking scaling.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use simple scaling </strong>is incorrect because you need to wait for the cooldown period to complete before initiating additional scaling activities. Target tracking or step scaling policies can trigger a scaling activity immediately without waiting for the cooldown period to expire.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use scheduled scaling</strong> is incorrect because this policy is mainly used for predictable traffic patterns. You need to use the target tracking scaling policy to optimize the cost of your infrastructure without affecting the performance.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use suspend and resume scaling</strong> is incorrect because this type is used to temporarily pause scaling activities triggered by your scaling policies and scheduled actions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-target-tracking.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-target-tracking.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Auto Scaling Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-auto-scaling/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-auto-scaling/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>An online medical system hosted in AWS stores sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of the users in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. </p><p>Which S3 encryption technique should the Architect use?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Client-side encryption</strong> is the act of encrypting data before sending it to Amazon S3. To enable client-side encryption, you have the following options:</p><p>- Use an AWS KMS key.</p><p>- Use a client-side master key.</p><p>When using an AWS KMS key to enable client-side data encryption, you provide an AWS KMS key identifier (KeyId) to AWS. On the other hand, when you use client-side master key for client-side data encryption, your client-side master keys and your unencrypted data are never sent to AWS. It's important that you safely manage your encryption keys because if you lose them, you can't decrypt your data.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/s3_sse_customer_key_2.png\"></p><p>This is how client-side encryption using a client-side master key works:</p><p><strong>When uploading an object</strong> - You provide a client-side master key to the Amazon S3 encryption client. The client uses the master key only to encrypt the data encryption key that it generates randomly. The process works like this:</p><p>1. The Amazon S3 encryption client generates a one-time-use symmetric key (also known as a data encryption key or data key) locally. It uses the data key to encrypt the data of a single Amazon S3 object. The client generates a separate data key for each object.</p><p>2. The client encrypts the data encryption key using the master key that you provide. The client uploads the encrypted data key and its material description as part of the object metadata. The client uses the material description to determine which client-side master key to use for decryption.</p><p>3. The client uploads the encrypted data to Amazon S3 and saves the encrypted data key as object metadata (<code>x-amz-meta-x-amz-key</code>) in Amazon S3.</p><p><strong>When downloading an object - </strong>The client downloads the encrypted object from Amazon S3. Using the material description from the object's metadata, the client determines which master key to use to decrypt the data key. The client uses that master key to decrypt the data key and then uses the data key to decrypt the object.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Use S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key</strong>.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use S3 client-side encryption with an AWS KMS key</strong> is incorrect because, in client-side encryption with a KMS key, you provide an AWS KMS key identifier (KeyId) to AWS. The scenario clearly indicates that both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use S3 server-side encryption with an AWS KMS key</strong> is incorrect because the scenario mentioned that the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS, which means that you have to use client-side encryption in order to encrypt the data first before sending to AWS. In this way, you can only ensure that there is no unencrypted data being uploaded to AWS. In addition, the master key used by Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS Key (SSE-KMS) is uploaded and managed by AWS, which directly violates the requirement of not uploading the master key.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key</strong> is incorrect because, just as mentioned above, you have to use client-side encryption in this scenario instead of server-side encryption. For the S3 server-side encryption with a customer-provided key (SSE-C), you actually provide the encryption key as part of your request to upload the object to S3. Using this key, Amazon S3 manages both the encryption (as it writes to disks) and decryption (when you access your objects).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingEncryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingEncryption.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A company is in the process of migrating their applications to AWS. One of their systems requires a database that can scale globally and handle frequent schema changes. The application should not have any downtime or performance issues whenever there is a schema change in the database. It should also provide a low latency response to high-traffic queries.</p><p>Which is the most suitable database solution to use to achieve this requirement?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Applications and Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Before we proceed in answering this question, we must first be clear with the actual definition of a \"<strong>schema</strong>\". Basically, the english definition of a schema is: <em>a representation of a plan or theory in the form of an outline or model</em>.</p><p>Just think of a schema as the \"structure\" or a \"model\" of your data in your database. Since the scenario requires that the schema, or the structure of your data, changes frequently, then you have to pick a database which provides a non-rigid and flexible way of adding or removing new types of data. This is a classic example of choosing between a relational database and non-relational (NoSQL) database.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/2019-03-08_21-57-30-7860e883ac634eb2e771a5f4694cbafa.png\"></p><p>A relational database is known for having a rigid schema, with a lot of constraints and limits as to which (and what type of ) data can be inserted or not. It is primarily used for scenarios where you have to support complex queries which fetch data across a number of tables. It is best for scenarios where you have complex table relationships but for use cases where you need to have a flexible schema, this is not a suitable database to use.</p><p>For NoSQL, it is not as rigid as a relational database because you can easily add or remove rows or elements in your table/collection entry. It also has a more flexible schema because it can store complex hierarchical data within a single item which, unlike a relational database, does not entail changing multiple related tables. Hence, the best answer to be used here is a NoSQL database, like DynamoDB. When your business requires a low-latency response to high-traffic queries, taking advantage of a NoSQL system generally makes technical and economic sense.</p><p>Amazon DynamoDB helps solve the problems that limit the relational system scalability by avoiding them. In DynamoDB, you design your schema specifically to make the most common and important queries as fast and as inexpensive as possible. Your data structures are tailored to the specific requirements of your business use cases.</p><p>Remember that a relational database system <strong>does not scale</strong> well for the following reasons:</p><p>- It normalizes data and stores it on multiple tables that require multiple queries to write to disk.</p><p>- It generally incurs the performance costs of an ACID-compliant transaction system.</p><p>- It uses expensive joins to reassemble required views of query results.</p><p><br></p><p>For <strong>DynamoDB</strong>, it scales well due to these reasons:</p><p>- Its<strong> schema flexibility</strong> lets DynamoDB store complex hierarchical data within a single item. DynamoDB is not a totally <em>schemaless</em> database since the very definition of a schema is just the model or structure of your data.</p><p>- Composite key design lets it store related items close together on the same table.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>An Amazon RDS instance in Multi-AZ Deployments configuration</strong> and <strong>an Amazon Aurora database with Read Replicas</strong> are incorrect because both of them are a type of relational database.</p><p><strong>Redshift</strong> is incorrect because it is primarily used for OLAP systems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-general-nosql-design.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-general-nosql-design.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-relational-modeling.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-relational-modeling.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SQLtoNoSQL.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SQLtoNoSQL.html</a></p><p><br></p><p>Also check the <strong><em>AWS Certified Solutions Architect Official Study Guide: Associate Exam</em></strong> 1st Edition and turn to page 161 which talks about NoSQL Databases.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon DynamoDB Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-dynamodb/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-dynamodb</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorials Dojo's AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam Study Guide:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/</a></p>",

RAM eliminates the need to create duplicate resources in multiple accounts, reducing the operational overhead of managing those resources in every single account you own.

Although you can delegate access to resources that are in different AWS accounts using IAM, this process is extremely tedious and entails a lot of operational overhead since you have to manually set up cross-account access to each and every AWS account of the company. A better solution is to use AWS Resources Access Manager instead.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use AWS Control Tower to easily and securely share your resources with your AWS accounts </strong>is incorrect because AWS Control Tower simply offers the easiest way to set up and govern a new, secure, multi-account AWS environment.

    "question": "<p>A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.</p><p>Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Scaling based on a schedule allows you to scale your application in response to predictable load changes. For example, every week the traffic to your web application starts to increase on Wednesday, remains high on Thursday, and starts to decrease on Friday. You can plan your scaling activities based on the predictable traffic patterns of your web application.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/scheduled-scaling-action-ec2.png\"></p><p>To configure your Auto Scaling group to scale based on a schedule, you create a scheduled action. The scheduled action tells Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to perform a scaling action at specified times. To create a scheduled scaling action, you specify the start time when the scaling action should take effect and the new minimum, maximum, and desired sizes for the scaling action. At the specified time, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling updates the group with the values for minimum, maximum, and desired size specified by the scaling action. You can create scheduled actions for scaling one time only or for scaling on a recurring schedule.</p><p>Hence, <strong>configuring a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day</strong> is the correct answer. You need to configure a Scheduled scaling policy. This will ensure that the instances are already scaled up and ready before the start of the day since this is when the application is used the most.</p><p>The following options are both incorrect. Although these are valid solutions, it is still better to configure a Scheduled scaling policy as you already know the exact peak hours of your application. By the time either the CPU or Memory hits a peak, the application already has performance issues, so you need to ensure the scaling is done beforehand using a Scheduled scaling policy:</p><p><strong>-Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization</strong></p><p><strong>-Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances</strong> is incorrect. Although this type of scaling policy can be used in this scenario, it is not the most operationally efficient option. Take note that the scenario mentioned that the Auto Scaling group consists of Amazon EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. Predictive scaling assumes that your Auto Scaling group is homogenous, which means that all EC2 instances are of equal capacity. The forecasted capacity can be inaccurate if you are using a variety of EC2 instance sizes and types on your Auto Scaling group.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/schedule_time.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/schedule_time.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.html#predictive-scaling-limitations\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.html#predictive-scaling-limitations</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Auto Scaling Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-auto-scaling/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-auto-scaling/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A company is using Amazon S3 to store frequently accessed data. When an object is created or deleted, the S3 bucket will send an event notification to the Amazon SQS queue. A solutions architect needs to create a solution that will notify the development and operations team about the created or deleted objects.</p><p>Which of the following would satisfy this requirement?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>The <strong>Amazon S3</strong> notification feature enables you to receive notifications when certain events happen in your bucket. To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration that identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications. You store this configuration in the notification subresource that is associated with a bucket.</p><p>Amazon S3 supports the following destinations where it can publish events:</p><p>- Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic</p><p>- Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue</p><p>- AWS Lambda</p><p>In Amazon SNS, the <em>fanout</em> scenario is when a message published to an SNS topic is replicated and pushed to multiple endpoints, such as Amazon SQS queues, HTTP(S) endpoints, and Lambda functions. This allows for parallel asynchronous processing.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/event_driven_sns_compute_slide05.png\"></p><p>For example, you can develop an application that publishes a message to an SNS topic whenever an order is placed for a product. Then, SQS queues that are subscribed to the SNS topic receive identical notifications for the new order. An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) server instance attached to one of the SQS queues can handle the processing or fulfillment of the order. And you can attach another Amazon EC2 server instance to a data warehouse for analysis of all orders received.</p><p>Based on the given scenario, the existing setup sends the event notification to an SQS queue. Since you need to send the notification to the development and operations team, you can use a combination of Amazon SNS and SQS. By using the message fanout pattern, you can create a topic and use two Amazon SQS queues to subscribe to the topic. If Amazon SNS receives an event notification, it will publish the message to both subscribers.</p><p>Take note that Amazon S3 event notifications are designed to be delivered at least once and to one destination only. You cannot attach two or more SNS topics or SQS queues for S3 event notification. Therefore, you must send the event notification to Amazon SNS.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is:<strong> Create an Amazon SNS topic and configure two SQS queues to subscribe to the topic. Grant S3 permission to send notifications to SNS and update the bucket to use the new SNS topic.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Set up another SQS queue for the other team. Grant S3 permission to send a notification to the second SQS queue </strong>is incorrect because you can only add 1 SQS or SNS at a time for Amazon S3 events notification. If you need to send the events to multiple subscribers, you should implement a message fanout pattern with Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Create a new Amazon SNS FIFO topic for the other team. Grant S3 permission to send the notification to the second SNS topic </strong>is incorrect. Just as mentioned in the previous option, you can only add 1 SQS or SNS at a time for Amazon S3 events notification. In addition, neither Amazon SNS FIFO topic nor Amazon SQS FIFO queue is warranted in this scenario. Both of them can be used together to provide strict message ordering and message deduplication. The FIFO capabilities of each of these services work together to act as a fully managed service to integrate distributed applications that require data consistency in near-real-time.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Set up an Amazon SNS topic and configure two SQS queues to poll the SNS topic. Grant S3 permission to send notifications to SNS and update the bucket to use the new SNS topic </strong>is incorrect because you can't poll Amazon SNS. Instead of configuring queues to poll Amazon SNS, you should configure each Amazon SQS queue to subscribe to the SNS topic.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html#notification-how-to-overview\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html#notification-how-to-overview</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A government agency plans to store confidential tax documents on AWS. Due to the sensitive information in the files, the Solutions Architect must restrict the data access requests made to the storage solution to a specific Amazon VPC only. The solution should also prevent the files from being deleted or overwritten to meet the regulatory requirement of having a write-once-read-many (WORM) storage model.</p><p>Which combination of the following options should the Architect implement? (Select TWO.)</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Amazon S3 access points simplify data access for any AWS service or customer application that stores data in S3. Access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as <code>GetObject</code> and <code>PutObject</code>.</p><p>Each access point has distinct permissions and network controls that S3 applies for any request that is made through that access point. Each access point enforces a customized access point policy that works in conjunction with the bucket policy that is attached to the underlying bucket. You can configure any access point to accept requests only from a virtual private cloud (VPC) to restrict Amazon S3 data access to a private network. You can also configure custom block public access settings for each access point.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3-access-points-via-vpc.png\"></p><p>You can also use Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points to provide a global endpoint that applications can use to fulfill requests from S3 buckets located in multiple AWS Regions. You can use Multi-Region Access Points to build multi-Region applications with the same simple architecture used in a single Region, and then run those applications anywhere in the world. Instead of sending requests over the congested public internet, Multi-Region Access Points provide built-in network resilience with acceleration of internet-based requests to Amazon S3. Application requests made to a Multi-Region Access Point global endpoint use AWS Global Accelerator to automatically route over the AWS global network to the S3 bucket with the lowest network latency.</p><p>With S3 Object Lock, you can store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. You can use Object Lock to help meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage, or to simply add another layer of protection against object changes and deletion.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/td-s3-object-lock-08-14-2024.png\"></p><p>Before locking any objects, it is essential to enable S3 Object Lock on a bucket. Previously, Object Lock could only be enabled at the time of bucket creation, but now, Amazon S3 allows you to enable S3 Object Lock for existing buckets with just a few clicks. Once S3 Object Lock is enabled on a bucket, it allows you to lock objects within that bucket to prevent them from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. While Object Lock can now be enabled on existing buckets, it is important to note that once enabled, Object Lock itself cannot be disabled. However, you can still manage and configure object lock settings, including retention periods and legal holds, but the core feature of Object Lock remains active and irreversible. Also, versioning, which is required for Object Lock, cannot be suspended or disabled once Object Lock is enabled on the bucket.</p><p>Hence, the correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- Configure an Amazon S3 Access Point for the S3 bucket to restrict data access to a particular VPC only.</strong></p><p><strong>- Create a new Amazon S3 bucket with the S3 Object Lock feature enabled. Store the documents in the bucket and set the Legal Hold option for object retention.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up a new Amazon S3 bucket to store the tax documents and integrate it with AWS Network Firewall. Configure the Network Firewall to only accept data access requests from a specific VPC</strong> is incorrect because you cannot directly use an AWS Network Firewall to restrict S3 bucket data access requests to a specific Amazon VPC only. You have to use an Amazon S3 Access Point instead for this particular use case. An AWS Network Firewall is commonly integrated to your Amazon VPC and not to an S3 bucket.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Store the tax documents in the Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class. Use the </strong><code><strong>PutBucketPolicy</strong></code><strong> API to apply a bucket policy that restricts access requests to a specific VPC</strong> is incorrect because Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is just an archive storage class that delivers the lowest-cost storage for long-lived data that is rarely accessed and requires retrieval in milliseconds. Additionally, using a bucket policy to restrict access from a VPC is less efficient compared to using an S3 Access Point.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Enable Object Lock but disable Object Versioning on the new Amazon S3 bucket to comply with the write-once-read-many (WORM) storage model requirement</strong> is incorrect. Although the Object Lock feature does provide write-once-read-many (WORM) storage, the Object Versioning feature must also be enabled in order for this to work. In fact, you cannot manually disable the Object Versioning feature if you have already selected the Object Lock option.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p>",

    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Since the company is using Microsoft Active Directory which implements Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), you can set up a SAML-Based Federation for API Access to your AWS cloud. In this way, you can easily connect to AWS using the login credentials of your on-premises network.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/saml-based-sso-to-console.diagram.png\"></p><p>AWS supports identity federation with SAML 2.0, an open standard that many identity providers (IdPs) use. This feature enables federated single sign-on (SSO), so users can log into the AWS Management Console or call the AWS APIs without you having to create an IAM user for everyone in your organization. By using SAML, you can simplify the process of configuring federation with AWS, because you can use the IdP's service instead of writing custom identity proxy code.</p><p>Before you can use SAML 2.0-based federation as described in the preceding scenario and diagram, you must configure your organization's IdP and your AWS account to trust each other. The general process for configuring this trust is described in the following steps. Inside your organization, you must have an IdP that supports SAML 2.0, like Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS, part of Windows Server), Shibboleth, or another compatible SAML 2.0 provider.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Set up SAML 2.0-Based Federation by using a Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Setting up SAML 2.0-Based Federation by using a Web Identity Federation</strong> is incorrect because this is primarily used to let users sign in via a well-known external identity provider (IdP), such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google. It does not utilize Active Directory.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Using IAM users</strong> is incorrect because the situation requires you to use the existing credentials stored in their Active Directory, and not user accounts that will be generated by IAM.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Using Amazon VPC</strong> is incorrect because this only lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.

Most of the time, the application has low user activity but it receives bursts of traffic within seconds whenever there is a new product announcement. The Solutions Architect needs to create a solution that will allow users around the globe to access the data using an API.</p><p>What should the Solutions Architect do meet the above requirement?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>AWS Lambda</strong> lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code, and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.</p><p>The first time you invoke your function, AWS Lambda creates an instance of the function and runs its handler method to process the event. When the function returns a response, it stays active and waits to process additional events. If you invoke the function again while the first event is being processed, Lambda initializes another instance, and the function processes the two events concurrently. As more events come in, Lambda routes them to available instances and creates new instances as needed. When the number of requests decreases, Lambda stops unused instances to free up the scaling capacity for other functions.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/features-scaling.png\"></p><p>Your functions' <em>concurrency</em> is the number of instances that serve requests at a given time. For an initial burst of traffic, your functions' cumulative concurrency in a Region can reach an initial level of between 500 and 3000, which varies per Region.</p><p>Based on the given scenario, you need to create a solution that will satisfy the two requirements. The first requirement is to create a solution that will allow the users to access the data using an API. To implement this solution, you can use Amazon API Gateway. The second requirement is to handle the burst of traffic within seconds. You should use AWS Lambda in this scenario because Lambda functions can absorb reasonable bursts of traffic for approximately 15-30 minutes.</p><p>Lambda can scale faster than the regular Auto Scaling feature of Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, or Amazon ECS. This is because AWS Lambda is more lightweight than other computing services. Under the hood, Lambda can run your code to thousands of available AWS-managed EC2 instances (that could already be running) within seconds to accommodate traffic. This is faster than the Auto Scaling process of launching new EC2 instances that could take a few minutes or so. An alternative is to overprovision your compute capacity but that will incur significant costs.

    "question": "<p>An online cryptocurrency exchange platform is hosted in AWS which uses ECS Cluster and RDS in Multi-AZ Deployments configuration. The application is heavily using the RDS instance to process complex read and write database operations. To maintain the reliability, availability, and performance of your systems, you have to closely monitor how the different processes or threads on a DB instance use the CPU, including the percentage of the CPU bandwidth and total memory consumed by each process.   </p><p>Which of the following is the most suitable solution to properly monitor your database?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Amazon RDS provides metrics in real time for the operating system (OS) that your DB instance runs on. You can view the metrics for your DB instance using the console, or consume the Enhanced Monitoring JSON output from CloudWatch Logs in a monitoring system of your choice. By default, Enhanced Monitoring metrics are stored in the CloudWatch Logs for 30 days. To modify the amount of time the metrics are stored in the CloudWatch Logs, change the retention for the <code>RDSOSMetrics</code> log group in the CloudWatch console.</p><p>Take note that there are certain differences between CloudWatch and Enhanced Monitoring Metrics. CloudWatch gathers metrics about CPU utilization from the hypervisor for a DB instance, and Enhanced Monitoring gathers its metrics from an agent on the instance. As a result, you might find differences between the measurements, because the hypervisor layer performs a small amount of work. Hence, <strong>enabling Enhanced Monitoring in RDS</strong> is the correct answer in this specific scenario.</p><p>The differences can be greater if your DB instances use smaller instance classes, because then there are likely more virtual machines (VMs) that are managed by the hypervisor layer on a single physical instance. Enhanced Monitoring metrics are useful when you want to see how different processes or threads on a DB instance use the CPU.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/metrics2.png\"></p><p><strong>Using Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the CPU Utilization of your database</strong> is incorrect. Although you can use this to monitor the CPU Utilization of your database instance, it does not provide the percentage of the CPU bandwidth and total memory consumed by each database process in your RDS instance. Take note that CloudWatch gathers metrics about CPU utilization from the hypervisor for a DB instance while RDS Enhanced Monitoring gathers its metrics from an agent on the instance.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a script that collects and publishes custom metrics to CloudWatch, which tracks the real-time CPU Utilization of the RDS instance and then set up a custom CloudWatch dashboard to view the metrics</strong> is incorrect. Although you can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch dashboard to monitor the CPU Utilization of the database instance, using CloudWatch alone is still not enough to get the specific percentage of the CPU bandwidth and total memory consumed by each database processes. The data provided by CloudWatch is not as detailed as compared with the Enhanced Monitoring feature in RDS. Take note as well that you do not have direct access to the instances/servers of your RDS database instance, unlike with your EC2 instances where you can install a CloudWatch agent or a custom script to get CPU and memory utilization of your instance.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Check the </strong><code><strong>CPU%</strong></code><strong> and </strong><code><strong>MEM%</strong></code><strong> metrics which are readily available in the Amazon RDS console that shows the percentage of the CPU bandwidth and total memory consumed by each database process of your RDS instance</strong> is incorrect because the CPU% and MEM% metrics are not readily available in the Amazon RDS console, which is contrary to what is being stated in this option.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.CloudWatchLogs\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.CloudWatchLogs</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MonitoringOverview.html#monitoring-cloudwatch\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MonitoringOverview.html#monitoring-cloudwatch</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon CloudWatch Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloudwatch/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloudwatch/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon RDS Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-relational-database-service-amazon-rds/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-relational-database-service-amazon-rds/</a></p>",

    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>A <strong>security group</strong> acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to the instance. Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC can be assigned to a different set of security groups.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/AWS-SG-InboundRuleSSH.PNG\"></p><p>The requirement is to only allow the individual IP of the client and not the entire network. The /32 CIDR notation denotes a single IP address. Take note that the SSH protocol uses TCP, not UDP, and runs on port 22 (default). In the scenario, we can create a security group with an inbound rule allowing incoming traffic from the specified IP address on port 22.</p><p>Security groups are stateful, meaning they automatically allow return traffic associated with the client who initiated the connection to the instance. Therefore, any return traffic from the specified IP address on port 22 will be allowed to pass through the security group, regardless of whether or not there is an explicit outbound rule allowing it.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Security Group Inbound Rule: Protocol – TCP, Port Range – 22, Source 110.238.98.71/32</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Security Group Inbound Rule: Protocol – UDP, Port Range – 22, Source 110.238.98.71/32</strong> is incorrect because it typically uses UDP instead of TCP. SSH runs over the TCP protocol, so specifying UDP would not allow the desired access.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Security Group Outbound Rule: Protocol – TCP, Port Range – 22, Destination 110.238.98.71/32</strong> is incorrect because it's an outbound rule, not an inbound rule. Outbound rules control traffic leaving the instance. In the scenario, we need to limit inbound traffic coming from a specific address.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Security Group Outbound Rule: Protocol – UDP, Port Range – 22, Destination 0.0.0.0/0</strong> is incorrect because it is an outbound rule rather than an inbound rule.

The result was that all 1200 employees would be granted access to use Amazon S3 for the storage of their personal documents.</p><p>Which of the following will you need to consider so you can set up a solution that incorporates a single sign-on feature from your corporate AD or LDAP directory and also restricts access for each individual user to a designated user folder in an S3 bucket? (Select TWO.)</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>The question refers to one of the common scenarios for temporary credentials in AWS. Temporary credentials are useful in scenarios that involve identity federation, delegation, cross-account access, and IAM roles. In this example, it is called <strong>enterprise identity federation,</strong> considering that you also need to set up a single sign-on (SSO) capability.</p><p>The correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- Setup a Federation proxy or an Identity provider, and use AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary tokens</strong></p><p><strong>- Configure an IAM role and an IAM Policy to access the bucket.</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/saml-based-federation.diagram.png\">In an enterprise identity federation, you can authenticate users in your organization's network, and then provide those users access to AWS without creating new AWS identities for them and requiring them to sign in with a separate user name and password. This is known as the <em>single sign-on</em> (SSO) approach to temporary access. AWS STS supports open standards like Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0, with which you can use Microsoft AD FS to leverage your Microsoft Active Directory. You can also use SAML 2.0 to manage your own solution for federating user identities.</p><p><strong>Using 3rd party Single Sign-On solutions such as Atlassian Crowd, OKTA, OneLogin and many others </strong>is incorrect since you don't have to use 3rd party solutions to provide the access. AWS already provides the necessary tools that you can use in this situation.</p><p><strong>Mapping each individual user to a designated user folder in S3 using Amazon WorkDocs to access their personal documents</strong> is incorrect as there is no direct way of integrating Amazon S3 with Amazon WorkDocs for this particular scenario. Amazon WorkDocs is simply a fully managed, secure content creation, storage, and collaboration service. With Amazon WorkDocs, you can easily create, edit, and share content. And because it’s stored centrally on AWS, you can access it from anywhere on any device.</p><p><strong>Setting up a matching IAM user for each of the 1200 users in your corporate directory that needs access to a folder in the S3 bucket</strong> is incorrect since creating that many IAM users would be unnecessary.

    "question": "<p>An e-commerce company utilizes a regional Amazon API Gateway to host its public REST APIs. The API Gateway endpoint is accessed through a custom domain name set up with an Amazon Route 53 alias record. To support continuous improvement, the company intends to launch a new version of its APIs with enhanced features and performance optimizations.</p><p>How can the company reduce customer disruption and ensure MINIMAL data loss during the update process in the MOST cost-effective way?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong> is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It is a front door for your APIs, enabling you to design and implement scalable, highly available, and secure APIs. With Amazon API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs that any HTTP client, such as web browsers and mobile devices, can consume.</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/TD-API-Gateway-Canary-deployment.png\"></strong></p><p>Implementing a canary release deployment strategy for the API Gateway is a great way to ensure your APIs remain stable and reliable. This strategy involves releasing a new version of your API to a small subset of users, allowing you to test the latest version in a controlled environment.</p><p>If the new version performs well, you can gradually roll out the update to the rest of your users. This approach lets you catch any issues before they affect your entire user base, minimizing the impact on your customers. By using Amazon API Gateway, you can quickly implement a canary release deployment strategy, ensuring that your APIs are always up-to-date and performing at their best.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Implement a canary release deployment strategy for the API Gateway. Deploy the latest version of the APIs to a canary stage and direct a portion of the user traffic to this stage. Verify the new APIs. Gradually increase the traffic percentage, monitor for any issues, and, if successful, promote the canary stage to production.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Create a new API Gateway with the updated version of the APIs in OpenAPI JSON or YAML file format, but keep the same custom domain name for the new API Gateway</strong> is incorrect. Upgrading to a new API Gateway using an updated version of the APIs in OpenAPI JSON or YAML file format while keeping the same custom domain name can typically result in downtime and confusion during the switch. This is because of DNS propagation delays, which can negatively affect users and even lead to data loss.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Modify the existing API Gateway with the updated version of the APIs, but keep the same custom domain name for the new API Gateway by using the import-to-update operation in either overwrite or merge mode</strong> is incorrect. Using the import-to-update operation in either overwrite or merge mode may not provide enough isolation and control testing for the new version of the APIs. If something goes wrong during the update process, it could just lead to data loss on the existing API Gateway, potentially affecting all customers simultaneously.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Implement a blue-green deployment strategy for the API Gateway, deploying the latest version of the APIs to the green environment. Route some user traffic to it, validate the new APIs, and once thoroughly validated, promote the green environment to production</strong> is incorrect. In a blue-green deployment, the blue (existing) and green (updated) environments must be provisioned and maintained. This adds complexity and cost to the update process, which breaks the cost requirement that's explicitly mentioned in the scenario. Additionally, directing some user traffic to the green environment may only lead to issues for those users, especially if there are undiscovered bugs or performance problems in the updated APIs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/canary-release.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/canary-release.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-import-api-update.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-import-api-update.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon API Gateway Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-api-gateway/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-api-gateway/</a></p>",

As the number of users increases, the read replica faces difficulties keeping up with the increasing read traffic, causing performance bottlenecks during peak periods.</p><p>Which of the following will resolve the issue with the most cost-effective solution?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> is a cloud-based relational database service that provides better performance and reliability for database workloads. It is highly available and scalable, making it a great choice for businesses of any size. One of the key features of Amazon Aurora is Aurora Auto Scaling, which automatically adjusts the capacity of your Aurora database cluster based on the workload. This means that you don't have to worry about manually adjusting the ability of your database cluster to handle changes in demand. With Aurora Auto Scaling, you can be sure that your database cluster will always have the appropriate capacity to handle your workload while minimizing costs.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/Amazon-Aurora-06-29-2023.png\"></p><p><strong>Aurora Auto Scaling</strong> is particularly useful for businesses that have fluctuating workloads. It ensures that your database cluster scales up or down as needed without manual intervention. This feature saves time and resources, allowing businesses to focus on other aspects of their operations. Aurora Auto Scaling is also cost-effective, as it helps minimize unnecessary expenses associated with overprovisioning or underprovisioning database resources.</p><p>In this scenario, the company can benefit from using Aurora Auto Scaling. This solution allows the system to dynamically manage resources, effectively addressing the surge in read traffic during peak periods. This dynamic management of resources ensures that the company pays only for the extra resources when they are genuinely required.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Use automatic scaling for the Aurora read replica using Aurora Auto Scaling.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Increase the size of the Aurora DB cluster</strong> is incorrect because it's not economical to upsize the cluster just to alleviate the bottleneck during peak periods. A static increase in the DB cluster size results in constant costs, regardless of whether your database's resources are being fully utilized during off-peak periods or not.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Implement read scaling with Aurora Global Database</strong> is incorrect. Amazon Aurora Global Database is primarily designed for globally distributed applications, allowing a single Amazon Aurora database to span multiple AWS Regions. While this can provide global availability, it introduces additional complexity and can be more expensive due to infrastructure and data transfer costs.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up a read replica that can operate across different regions</strong> is incorrect. Setting up a read replica that operates across different regions can provide read scalability and load-balancing benefits by typically distributing the read traffic across regions. However, it is not the most cost-effective solution in this scenario since it incurs additional costs associated with inter-region data replication. Moreover, the issue is not related to cross-region availability but rather the read replica's performance within the current region.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Integrating.AutoScaling.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Integrating.AutoScaling.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon Aurora Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-aurora/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-aurora/</a></p>",

When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information about every modification to data items in the table.</p><p>Whenever an application creates, updates, or deletes items in the table, DynamoDB Streams writes a stream record with the primary key attribute(s) of the items that were modified. A <em>stream record </em>contains information about a data modification to a single item in a DynamoDB table. You can configure the stream so that the stream records capture additional information, such as the \"before\" and \"after\" images of modified items.</p><p>Amazon DynamoDB is integrated with AWS Lambda so that you can create <em>triggers</em>—pieces of code that automatically respond to events in DynamoDB Streams. With triggers, you can build applications that react to data modifications in DynamoDB tables.</p><p>If you enable DynamoDB Streams on a table, you can associate the stream ARN with a Lambda function that you write. Immediately after an item in the table is modified, a new record appears in the table's stream.

Although this is a valid solution, it is missing a vital step which is to enable DynamoDB Streams. With the DynamoDB Streams Kinesis Adapter in place, you can begin developing applications via the KCL interface, with the API calls seamlessly directed at the DynamoDB Streams endpoint. Remember that the DynamoDB Stream feature is not enabled by default.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create an AWS Lambda function that uses DynamoDB Streams Amazon Kinesis Adapter which will fetch data from the DynamoDB Streams endpoint.

By using AWS Glue, you can easily create and manage ETL jobs to transfer data from various sources, such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon Redshift. Additionally, AWS Glue enables you to transform your data as needed to fit your specific needs. One of the key advantages of AWS Glue is its automatic schema discovery and mapping, which allows you to easily map data from different sources with different schemas.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/aws_glue_s3_event_notification_via_SQS.png\"><br>When working with big data processing, it is often necessary to convert data from one format to another to optimize processing efficiency. Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format that is designed to provide higher efficiency and performance for big data processing. By storing and processing large amounts of data with high compression rates and faster query times, Parquet can offer significant benefits to the company. Fortunately, Parquet is compatible with many data processing frameworks such as Spark, Hive, and Hadoop, making it a versatile format for big data processing. By using AWS Glue and other AWS services, you can easily convert their .csv files to the more efficient Apache Parquet format and store the output files in an S3 bucket, making it easy to access and process large amounts of data.</p><p>Hence the correct answer is: <strong>Utilize an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to process and convert the </strong><code><strong>.csv</strong></code><strong> files to Apache Parquet format and then store the output files into the target S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Event Notification to track every </strong><code><strong>S3 PUT</strong></code><strong> event and invoke the ETL job in Glue through Amazon SQS.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use an AWS Lambda function triggered by an </strong><code><strong>S3 PUT</strong></code><strong> event to convert the </strong><code><strong>.csv</strong></code><strong> files to Parquet format. Use the AWS Transfer Family with SFTP service to move the output files to the target S3 bucket</strong> is incorrect. The conversion of the CSV files to Parquet format by using a combination of a Lambda function and S3 event notification would work; however, this is not the most efficient solution when primarily handling large amounts of data. The Lambda function has a maximum execution time limit which means that converting large files may result in timeout issues. Using the AWS Transfer Family with SFTP service to move the output files to the target S3 bucket is unnecessary too. Moreover, reading the records has to be delivered via a data stream since a Lambda function has a memory limit. This entails additional effort compared with using AWS Glue.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up an Apache Spark job running in an Amazon EC2 instance and create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to monitor </strong><code><strong>S3 PUT</strong></code><strong> events in the S3 bucket. Configure AWS Lambda to invoke the Spark job for every new </strong><code><strong>.csv</strong></code><strong> file added via a Function URL</strong> is incorrect. Running Spark on EC2 instances requires manual provisioning, monitoring, and maintenance, leading to time and additional costs. Additionally, using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to trigger the Spark job through a Function URL adds complexity and potential points of failure. Thus, this option just introduces unnecessary complexity and operational overhead.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) job and a Data Catalog table in AWS Glue. Configure the Glue crawler to run on a schedule to check for new files in the S3 bucket every hour and convert them to Parquet format</strong> is incorrect. Although it is right to create an ETL job using AWS Glue, simply triggering the job on a scheduled basis rather than being triggered automatically by a new file upload is not ideal. It is not as efficient as using an S3 event trigger to initiate the conversion process immediately upon file upload.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/run-aws-glue-crawlers-using-amazon-s3-event-notifications/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/run-aws-glue-crawlers-using-amazon-s3-event-notifications/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-format-parquet-home.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-format-parquet-home.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/glue-athena.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/glue-athena.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Glue Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-glue/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-glue/</a></p>",

Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead. </p>\n\n<p>In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?</p>",

    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong> provides throttling at multiple levels including global and by service call. Throttling limits can be set for standard rates and bursts. For example, API owners can set a rate limit of 1,000 requests per second for a specific method in their REST APIs, and also configure Amazon API Gateway to handle a burst of 2,000 requests per second for a few seconds. Amazon API Gateway tracks the number of requests per second. Any request over the limit will receive a 429 HTTP response. The client SDKs generated by Amazon API Gateway retry calls automatically when met with this response. Hence, <strong>enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway</strong> is the correct answer.</p><p>You can add caching to API calls by provisioning an Amazon API Gateway cache and specifying its size in gigabytes. The cache is provisioned for a specific stage of your APIs. This improves performance and reduces the traffic sent to your back end. Cache settings allow you to control the way the cache key is built and the time-to-live (TTL) of the data stored for each method. Amazon API Gateway also exposes management APIs that help you invalidate the cache for each stage.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/api-gw-settings.png\"></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling</strong> is incorrect since there is no need to transfer your applications to other services.</p><p><strong>Using CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache</strong> is incorrect because CloudFront only speeds up content delivery which provides a better latency experience for your users. It does not help much for the backend.</p><p><strong>Moving the Lambda function in a VPC</strong> is incorrect because this answer is irrelevant to what is being asked.

    "multiple": true,

    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong> has available Amazon EC2 Metrics for you to use for monitoring CPU utilization, Network utilization, Disk performance, and Disk Reads/Writes.

This agent supports both Windows Server and Linux and enables you to select the metrics to be collected, including sub-resource metrics such as per-CPU core.

    "explanation": "<p>You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, AWS Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and session policies.</p><p>IAM policies define permissions for action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation. For example, if a policy allows the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetUser.html\">GetUser</a> action, then a user with that policy can get user information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API. When you create an IAM user, you can choose to allow console or programmatic access. If console access is allowed, the IAM user can sign in to the console using a user name and password. Or if programmatic access is allowed, the user can use access keys to work with the CLI or API.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/CC_Diagram1_0717.png\"></p><p>Based on the provided IAM policy, the user is only allowed to get, write, and list all of the objects for the <code>boracay</code> s3 bucket.

The company has recently introduced a new member-only access feature for some of its high-quality media files. There is a requirement to provide access to multiple private media files only to paying subscribers without having to change the current URLs.</p><p>Which of the following is the most suitable solution to implement to satisfy this requirement?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Many companies that distribute content over the internet want to restrict access to documents, business data, media streams, or content that is intended for selected users, for example, users who have paid a fee. To securely serve this private content by using CloudFront, you can do the following:</p><p>- Require that your users access your private content by using special CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies.</p><p>- Require that your users access your content by using CloudFront URLs, not URLs that access content directly on the origin server (for example, Amazon S3 or a private HTTP server). Requiring CloudFront URLs isn't necessary, but we recommend it to prevent users from bypassing the restrictions that you specify in signed URLs or signed cookies.</p><p>CloudFront signed URLs and signed cookies provide the same basic functionality: they allow you to control who can access your content.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloud-front-signed-URL-signed-Cookies.png\"></p><p>If you want to serve private content through CloudFront and you're trying to decide whether to use signed URLs or signed cookies, consider the following:</p><p>Use <strong>signed URLs</strong> for the following cases:</p><p>- You want to use an RTMP distribution. Signed cookies aren't supported for RTMP distributions.</p><p>- You want to restrict access to individual files, for example, an installation download for your application.</p><p>- Your users are using a client (for example, a custom HTTP client) that doesn't support cookies.</p><p>Use <strong>signed cookies</strong> for the following cases:</p><p>- You want to provide access to multiple restricted files, for example, all of the files for a video in HLS format or all of the files in the subscribers' area of a website.</p><p>- You don't want to change your current URLs.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Use Signed Cookies to control who can access the private files in your CloudFront distribution by modifying your application to determine whether a user should have access to your content. For members, send the required </strong><code><strong>Set-Cookie</strong></code><strong> headers to the viewer which will unlock the content only to them.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Configure your CloudFront distribution to use Match Viewer as its Origin Protocol Policy which will automatically match the user request. This will allow access to the private content if the request is a paying member and deny it if it is not a member</strong> is incorrect because a Match Viewer is an Origin Protocol Policy that configures CloudFront to communicate with your origin using HTTP or HTTPS, depending on the protocol of the viewer request. CloudFront caches the object only once even if viewers make requests using both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a Signed URL with a custom policy which only allows the members to see the private files</strong> is incorrect because Signed URLs are primarily used for providing access to individual files, as shown in the above explanation. In addition, the scenario explicitly says that they don't want to change their current URLs which is why implementing Signed Cookies is more suitable than Signed URLs.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Configure your CloudFront distribution to use Field-Level Encryption to protect your private data and only allow access to members</strong> is incorrect because Field-Level Encryption only allows you to securely upload user-submitted sensitive information to your web servers. It does not provide access to download multiple private files.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-choosing-signed-urls-cookies.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-choosing-signed-urls-cookies.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-cookies.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-cookies.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon CloudFront Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloudfront/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloudfront/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>An online shopping platform is hosted on an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 Spot instances and utilizes Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL as its database. It is required to optimize database workloads in the cluster by directing the production traffic to high-capacity instances and routing the reporting queries from the internal staff to the low-capacity instances.</p><p>Which is the most suitable configuration for the application as well as the Aurora database cluster to achieve this requirement?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> typically involves a cluster of DB instances instead of a single instance. Each connection is handled by a specific DB instance. When you connect to an Aurora cluster, the host name and port that you specify point to an intermediate handler called an <em>endpoint</em>. Aurora uses the endpoint mechanism to abstract these connections. Thus, you don't have to hardcode all the hostnames or write your own logic for load-balancing and rerouting connections when some DB instances aren't available.</p><p>For certain Aurora tasks, different instances or groups of instances perform different roles. For example, the primary instance handles all data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas handle read-only query traffic.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/2019-04-03_00-40-18-850e58ca7802358579be53729bfc0cbb.gif\"></p><p>Using endpoints, you can map each connection to the appropriate instance or group of instances based on your use case. For example, to perform DDL statements you can connect to whichever instance is the primary instance. To perform queries, you can connect to the reader endpoint, with Aurora automatically performing load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas. For clusters with DB instances of different capacities or configurations, you can connect to custom endpoints associated with different subsets of DB instances. For diagnosis or tuning, you can connect to a specific instance endpoint to examine details about a specific DB instance.</p><p>The custom endpoint provides load-balanced database connections based on criteria other than the read-only or read-write capability of the DB instances. For example, you might define a custom endpoint to connect to instances that use a particular AWS instance class or a particular DB parameter group. Then you might tell particular groups of users about this custom endpoint. For example, you might direct internal users to low-capacity instances for report generation or ad hoc (one-time) querying, and direct production traffic to high-capacity instances.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Create a custom endpoint in Aurora based on the specified criteria for the production traffic and another custom endpoint to handle the reporting queries.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Configuring your application to use the reader endpoint for both production traffic and reporting queries, which will enable your Aurora database to automatically perform load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas</strong> is incorrect. Although it is true that a reader endpoint enables your Aurora database to automatically perform load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas, it is quite limited to doing read operations only. You still need to use a custom endpoint to load-balance the database connections based on the specified criteria.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>In your application, use the instance endpoint of your Aurora database to handle the incoming production traffic and use the cluster endpoint to handle reporting queries</strong> is incorrect because a cluster endpoint (also known as a writer endpoint) for an Aurora DB cluster simply connects to the current primary DB instance for that DB cluster. This endpoint can perform write operations in the database such as DDL statements, which is perfect for handling production traffic but not suitable for handling queries for reporting since there will be no write database operations that will be sent. Moreover, the endpoint does not point to lower-capacity or high-capacity instances as per the requirement. A better solution for this is to use a custom endpoint.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Do nothing since by default, Aurora will automatically direct the production traffic to your high-capacity instances and the reporting queries to your low-capacity instances</strong> is incorrect because Aurora does not do this by default. You have to create custom endpoints in order to accomplish this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.Endpoints.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.Endpoints.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Endpoints.Custom.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Endpoints.Custom.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon Aurora Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-aurora/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-aurora/</a></p>",

(Select TWO.)</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Lambda@Edge lets you run Lambda functions to customize the content that CloudFront delivers, executing the functions in AWS locations closer to the viewer. The functions run in response to CloudFront events, without provisioning or managing servers. You can use Lambda functions to change CloudFront requests and responses at the following points:</p><p>- After CloudFront receives a request from a viewer (viewer request)</p><p>- Before CloudFront forwards the request to the origin (origin request)</p><p>- After CloudFront receives the response from the origin (origin response)</p><p>- Before CloudFront forwards the response to the viewer (viewer response)</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/cloudfront-events-that-trigger-lambda-functions.png\"></p><p>In the given scenario, you can use Lambda@Edge to allow your Lambda functions to customize the content that CloudFront delivers and to execute the authentication process in AWS locations closer to the users. In addition, you can set up an origin failover by creating an origin group with two origins with one as the primary origin and the other as the second origin which CloudFront automatically switches to when the primary origin fails. This will alleviate the occasional HTTP 504 errors that users are experiencing.</p><p>Therefore, the correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- Customize the content that the CloudFront web distribution delivers to your users using Lambda@Edge, which allows your AWS Lambda functions to execute the authentication process in AWS locations closer to the users.</strong></p><p><strong>- Implement an origin failover by creating an origin group that includes two origins. Assign one as the primary origin and the other as secondary, which enables CloudFront to automatically switch to if the primary origin encounters specific HTTP status code failure responses.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Establish multiple Amazon VPCs in different AWS regions and configure a transit VPC to interconnect all of your resources. To handle the requests faster, set up AWS Lambda functions in each region with the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) service</strong> is incorrect because of the same reason provided above. Although setting up multiple VPCs across various regions which are just connected with a transit VPC is valid, this solution still entails higher setup and maintenance costs. A more cost-effective option would be to use Lambda@Edge instead.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Configure your origin to add a </strong><code><strong>Cache-Control max-age</strong></code><strong> directive to your objects, and specify the longest practical value for </strong><code><strong>max-age</strong></code><strong> to increase the cache hit ratio of your CloudFront distribution</strong> is incorrect because improving the cache hit ratio for the CloudFront distribution is irrelevant in this scenario. You can only improve your cache performance by increasing the proportion of your viewer requests that are served from CloudFront edge caches instead of going to your origin servers for content. However, take note that the problem in the scenario is the sluggish authentication process of your global users and not just the caching of the static objects.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Deploy your application to multiple AWS regions to accommodate your users around the world. Set up a Route 53 record with latency routing policy to route incoming traffic to the region that provides the best latency to the user</strong> is incorrect. Although this may resolve the performance issue, this solution entails a significant implementation cost since you have to deploy your application to multiple AWS regions. Remember that the scenario asks for a solution that will improve the performance of the application with <strong>minimal cost</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/high_availability_origin_failover.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/high_availability_origin_failover.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out these Amazon CloudFront and AWS Lambda Cheat Sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloudfront/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloudfront/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-lambda/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-lambda/</a></p>",

These files must immediately be accessible within minutes for six months and archived for another decade to meet the data compliance. </p><p>Which of the following is the best and most cost-effective approach to implement in this scenario?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>A file gateway supports a file interface into Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and combines a service and a virtual software appliance. By using this combination, you can store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using industry-standard file protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB). The software appliance, or gateway, is deployed into your on-premises environment as a virtual machine (VM) running on VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, or Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/file-gateway.jpg\"></p><p>The gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files or file share mount points. With a file gateway, you can do the following:</p><p>- You can store and retrieve files directly using the NFS version 3 or 4.1 protocol.</p><p>- You can store and retrieve files directly using the SMB file system version, 2 and 3 protocol.</p><p>- You can access your data directly in Amazon S3 from any AWS Cloud application or service.</p><p>- You can manage your Amazon S3 data using lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and versioning. You can think of a file gateway as a file system mount on S3.</p><p>AWS Storage Gateway supports the Amazon S3 Standard, Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access, Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access and Amazon Glacier storage classes. When you create or update a file share, you have the option to select a storage class for your objects. You can either choose the Amazon S3 Standard or any of the infrequent access storage classes such as S3 Standard IA or S3 One Zone IA. Objects stored in any of these storage classes can be transitioned to Amazon Glacier using a Lifecycle Policy.</p><p>Although you can write objects directly from a file share to the S3-Standard-IA or S3-One Zone-IA storage class, it is recommended that you use a Lifecycle Policy to transition your objects rather than write directly from the file share, especially if you're expecting to update or delete the object within 30 days of archiving it.</p><p>Therefore, the correct answer is: <strong>Launch a new file gateway that connects to your on-premises data center using AWS Storage Gateway. Upload the documents to the file gateway and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for data archival.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Launch a new tape gateway that connects to your on-premises data center using AWS Storage Gateway. Upload the documents to the tape gateway and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for archival</strong> is incorrect because although tape gateways provide cost-effective and durable archive backup data in Amazon Glacier, it does not meet the criteria of being retrievable immediately within minutes. It also doesn't maintain a local cache that provides low latency access to the recently accessed data and reduce data egress charges. Thus, it is still better to set up a file gateway instead.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Establish a Direct Connect connection to integrate your on-premises network to your VPC. Upload the documents on Amazon EBS Volumes and use a lifecycle policy to automatically move the EBS snapshots to an S3 bucket, and then later to Glacier for archival</strong> is incorrect because EBS Volumes are not as durable compared with S3 and it would be more cost-efficient if you directly store the documents to an S3 bucket. An alternative solution is to use AWS Direct Connect with AWS Storage Gateway to create a connection for high-throughput workload needs, providing a dedicated network connection between your on-premises file gateway and AWS. But this solution is using EBS, hence, this option is still wrong.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use AWS Snowmobile to migrate all of the files from the on-premises network. Upload the documents to an S3 bucket and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for archival</strong> is incorrect because Snowmobile is mainly used to migrate the entire data of an on-premises data center to AWS. This is not a suitable approach as the company still has a hybrid cloud architecture which means that they will still use their on-premises data center along with their AWS cloud infrastructure.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/StorageGatewayConcepts.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/StorageGatewayConcepts.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorials Dojo's AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam Study Guide:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/</a></p>",

    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>The partition key portion of a table's primary key determines the logical partitions in which a table's data is stored. This in turn affects the underlying physical partitions. Provisioned I/O capacity for the table is divided evenly among these physical partitions. Therefore a partition key design that doesn't distribute I/O requests evenly can create \"hot\" partitions that result in throttling and use your provisioned I/O capacity inefficiently.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/DynamoDB-adaptive-capacity.png\"></p><p>The optimal usage of a table's provisioned throughput depends not only on the workload patterns of individual items, but also on the partition-key design. This doesn't mean that you must access all partition key values to achieve an efficient throughput level, or even that the percentage of accessed partition key values must be high. It does mean that the more distinct partition key values that your workload accesses, the more those requests will be spread across the partitioned space. In general, you will use your provisioned throughput more efficiently as the ratio of partition key values accessed to the total number of partition key values increases.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Use partition keys with high-cardinality attributes, which have a large number of distinct values for each item</strong>.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Reducing the number of partition keys in the DynamoDB table</strong> is incorrect. Instead of doing this, you should actually add more to improve its performance to distribute the I/O requests evenly and not simply avoid \"hot\" partitions.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Using partition keys with low-cardinality attributes, which have a few number of distinct values for each item</strong> is incorrect because this is only the exact opposite of the correct answer. Remember that the more distinct partition key values your workload accesses, the more those requests will be spread across the partitioned space. Conversely, the less distinct partition key values, the less evenly spread it would be across the partitioned space, which effectively slows the performance.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Avoid using a composite primary key, which is composed of a partition key and a sort key</strong> is incorrect because as mentioned, a composite primary key will provide more partition for the table and in turn, improves the performance. Hence, it should be used and not avoided.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-partition-key-uniform-load.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-partition-key-uniform-load.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/choosing-the-right-dynamodb-partition-key/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/choosing-the-right-dynamodb-partition-key/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon DynamoDB Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-dynamodb/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-dynamodb/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Amazon DynamoDB Overview:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/3ZOyUNIeorU\">https://youtu.be/3ZOyUNIeorU</a></p>",

    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</strong> is an easy-to-use, high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale. A broad range of workloads, such as relational and non-relational databases, enterprise applications, containerized applications, big data analytics engines, file systems, and media workflows are widely deployed on Amazon EBS.</p><p><strong>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</strong> is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.</p><p>In an <strong>S3 Lifecycle configuration</strong>, you can define rules to transition objects from one storage class to another to save on storage costs. Amazon S3 supports a waterfall model for transitioning between storage classes, as shown in the diagram below:</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/lifecycle-transitions-v2.png\"></p><p>In this scenario, three services are required to implement this solution. The mission-critical workloads mean that you need to have a persistent block storage volume and the designed service for this is Amazon EBS volumes. The second workload needs to have an object storage service, such as Amazon S3, to store your backup data. Amazon S3 enables you to configure the lifecycle policy from S3 Standard to different storage classes. For the last one, it needs archive storage such as Amazon S3 Glacier.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is: <strong>Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA</strong> is incorrect because this lifecycle policy will transition your objects into an infrequently accessed storage class and not a storage class for data archiving.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier</strong> is incorrect because an Instance Store volume is simply a temporary block-level storage for EC2 instances. Also, you can't attach instance store volumes to an instance after you've launched it. You can specify the instance store volumes for your instance only when you launch it.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA</strong> is incorrect. Just like the previous option, the use of instance store volume is not suitable for mission-critical workloads because the data can be lost if the underlying disk drive fails, the instance stops, or if the instance is terminated. In addition, Amazon S3 Glacier is a more suitable option for data archival instead of Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/\">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorials Dojo's AWS Storage Services Cheat Sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets-storage-services/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets-storage-services/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A medical records company is planning to store sensitive clinical trial data in an Amazon S3 repository with the object-level versioning feature enabled. The Solutions Architect is tasked with ensuring that no object can be overwritten or deleted by any user in a period of one year only. To meet the strict compliance requirements, the root user of the company’s AWS account must also be restricted from making any changes to an object in the S3 bucket.</p><p>Which of the following is the most secure way of storing the data in S3?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>With S3 Object Lock, you can store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. You can use Object Lock to help meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage or to simply add another layer of protection against object changes and deletion.</p><p>Before you lock any objects, you have to enable a bucket to use S3 Object Lock. You enable Object Lock when you create a bucket. After you enable Object Lock on a bucket, you can lock objects in that bucket. When you create a bucket with Object Lock enabled, you can't disable Object Lock or suspend versioning for that bucket.</p><p>S3 Object Lock provides two retention modes:</p><p>-Governance mode</p><p>-Compliance mode</p><p>These retention modes apply different levels of protection to your objects. You can apply either retention mode to any object version that is protected by Object Lock.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/Amazon-S3-Object-Lock-Retention-Modes.png\"></p><p>In governance mode, users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions. With governance mode, you protect objects against being deleted by most users, but you can still grant some users permission to alter the retention settings or delete the object if necessary. You can also use governance mode to test retention-period settings before creating a compliance-mode retention period.</p><p>In compliance mode, a protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account. When an object is locked in compliance mode, its retention mode can't be changed, and its retention period can't be shortened. Compliance mode helps ensure that an object version can't be overwritten or deleted for the duration of the retention period.</p><p>To override or remove governance-mode retention settings, a user must have the <code>s3:BypassGovernanceRetention</code> permission and must explicitly include <code>x-amz-bypass-governance-retention:true</code> as a request header with any request that requires overriding governance mode.</p><p><strong>Legal Hold vs. Retention Period</strong></p><p>With Object Lock, you can also place a legal hold on an object version. Like a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed. Legal holds can be freely placed and removed by any user who has the <code>s3:PutObjectLegalHold</code> permission.</p><p>Legal holds are independent from retention periods. As long as the bucket that contains the object has Object Lock enabled, you can place and remove legal holds regardless of whether the specified object version has a retention period set. Placing a legal hold on an object version doesn't affect the retention mode or retention period for that object version.</p><p>For example, suppose that you place a legal hold on an object version while the object version is also protected by a retention period. If the retention period expires, the object doesn't lose its WORM protection. Rather, the legal hold continues to protect the object until an authorized user explicitly removes it. Similarly, if you remove a legal hold while an object version has a retention period in effect, the object version remains protected until the retention period expires.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is:<strong> Enable S3 Object Lock in compliance mode with a retention period of one year.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Enable S3 Object Lock in governance mode with a retention period of one year</strong> is incorrect because in the governance mode, users typically can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions or if a user has access to the root AWS user account. A better option to choose here is to use the compliance mode.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Enable S3 Object Lock in governance mode with a legal hold of one year</strong> is incorrect. You cannot set a time period for a legal hold. You can only do this using the \"retention period\" option. Take note that a legal hold will still restrict users from changing the S3 objects even after the one-year retention period has elapsed. In addition, a governance mode will allow the root user to modify your S3 objects and override any existing settings.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Enable S3 Object Lock in compliance mode with a legal hold of one year</strong> is incorrect. Although the choice of using the compliance mode is right, you still cannot set a one-year time period for the legal hold option. Keep in mind that the legal hold is independent of the retention period.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p>",

You can configure your own CloudHSM cluster and authorize AWS KMS to use it as a dedicated key store for your keys rather than the default AWS KMS key store. When you create keys in AWS KMS you can choose to generate the key material in your CloudHSM cluster. KMS Keys that are generated in your custom key store never leave the HSMs in the CloudHSM cluster in plaintext and all AWS KMS operations that use those KMS keys are only performed on your HSMs.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/KMS_01.png\"></p><p>AWS KMS can help you integrate with other AWS services to encrypt the data that you store in these services and control access to the keys that decrypt it. To immediately remove the key material from AWS KMS, you can use a custom key store. Take note that each custom key store is associated with an AWS CloudHSM cluster in your AWS account. Therefore, when you create an AWS KMS Key in a custom key store, AWS KMS generates and stores the non-extractable key material for the KMS key in an AWS CloudHSM cluster that you own and manage. This is also suitable if you want to be able to audit the usage of all your keys independently of AWS KMS or AWS CloudTrail.</p><p>Since you control your AWS CloudHSM cluster, you have the option to manage the lifecycle of your KMS keys independently of AWS KMS.

    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>AWS Lake Formation</strong> is a service that makes it easy to set up a secure data lake in days. A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and guide better business decisions.</p><p>Amazon S3 forms the storage layer for Lake Formation. If you already use S3, you typically begin by registering existing S3 buckets that contain your data. Lake Formation creates new buckets for the data lake and imports data into them. AWS always stores this data in your account, and only you have direct access to it.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/aws-lake-formation-glue-crawler.png\"></p><p>AWS Lake Formation is integrated with AWS Glue which you can use to create a data catalog that describes available datasets and their appropriate business applications. Lake Formation lets you define policies and control data access with simple “grant and revoke permissions to data” sets at granular levels. You can assign permissions to IAM users, roles, groups, and Active Directory users using federation. You specify permissions on catalog objects (like tables and columns) rather than on buckets and objects.</p><p>Thus, the correct answer is: <strong>Use AWS Lake Formation to consolidate data from multiple accounts into a single account.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use Amazon Data Firehose to consolidate data from multiple accounts into a single account</strong> is incorrect. Setting up a Data Firehose in each and every account to move data into a single location is costly and impractical. A better approach is to set up cross-account sharing which is free with AWS Lake Formation.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a scheduled AWS Lambda function using AWS EventBridge for transferring data from multiple accounts to the S3 buckets of the central account</strong> is incorrect. This could be done by utilizing the AWS SDK, but implementation would be difficult and quite challenging to manage. Remember that the scenario explicitly mentioned that the solution must minimize management overhead.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use AWS Control Tower to centrally manage each account's S3 buckets </strong>is incorrect because the AWS Central Tower service is primarily used to manage and govern multiple AWS accounts and not just S3 buckets.

Having a fault-tolerant architecture entails an extra cost in running additional resources than what is usually needed. This is to ensure that the mission-critical workloads are processed.</p><p>Since the scenario requires at least 2 instances to handle regular traffic, you should have 2 instances running all the time even if an AZ outage occurred. You can use an Auto Scaling Group to automatically scale your compute resources across two or more Availability Zones.

It cannot protect your applications and data from datacenter or AZ failures.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and set the minimum capacity to 2 and the maximum capacity to 6. Use 2 Availability Zones and deploy 1 instance for each AZ</strong> is incorrect. It is required to have 2 instances running all the time. If an AZ outage happened, ASG will launch a new instance on the unaffected AZ. This provisioning does not happen instantly, which means that for a certain period of time, there will only be 1 running instance left.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and set the minimum capacity to 2 and the maximum capacity to 4. Deploy 2 instances in Availability Zone A and 2 instances in Availability Zone B</strong> is incorrect. Although this fulfills the requirement of at least 2 EC2 instances and high availability, the maximum capacity setting is wrong. It should be set to 6 to properly handle the peak load. If an AZ outage occurs and the system is at its peak load, the number of running instances in this setup will only be 4 instead of 6 and this will affect the performance of your application.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/regions-and-azs.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/regions-and-azs.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Auto Scaling Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-auto-scaling/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-auto-scaling/</a></p>",

The application will be used globally by users to upload and store several types of files. Based on user trends, files that are older than 2 years must be stored in a different storage class. The Solutions Architect of the company needs to create a cost-effective and scalable solution to store the old files yet still provide durability and high availability.</p><p>Which of the following approach can be used to fulfill this requirement? (Select TWO.)</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon S3</strong> stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any optional metadata that describes the file. To store a file in Amazon S3, you upload it to a bucket. When you upload a file as an object, you can set permissions on the object and any metadata. Buckets are containers for objects. You can have one or more buckets. You can control access for each bucket, deciding who can create, delete, and list objects in it. You can also choose the geographical region where Amazon S3 will store the bucket and its contents and view access logs for the bucket and its objects.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/lifecycle-transitions-v2.png\"></p><p>To move a file to a different storage class, you can use Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS. Both services have lifecycle configurations. Take note that Amazon EFS can only transition a file to the IA storage class after 90 days. Since you need to move the files that are older than 2 years to a more cost-effective and scalable solution, you should use the Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration. With S3 lifecycle rules, you can transition files to S3 Standard IA or S3 Glacier. Using S3 Glacier expedited retrieval, you can quickly access your files within 1-5 minutes.</p><p>Hence, the correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- Use Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy that will move the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 2 years.</strong></p><p><strong>- Use Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy that will move the objects to Amazon S3 Standard-IA after 2 years.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use Amazon EFS and create a lifecycle policy that will move the objects to Amazon EFS-IA after 2 years </strong>is incorrect because the maximum days of EFS lifecycle policies is only up to 365 days. Therefore, it still does not meet the requirement of moving files older than 2 years or 730 days.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use Amazon EBS volumes to store the files. Configure the Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) to schedule snapshots of the volumes after 2 years</strong> is incorrect because the Amazon EBS simply costs more and is not as scalable as Amazon S3. It has some limitations when accessed by multiple EC2 instances. There are also huge costs involved in using the multi-attach feature on a Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to allow multiple EC2 instances to access the volume.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use a RAID 0 storage configuration that stripes multiple Amazon EBS volumes together to store the files. Configure the Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) to schedule snapshots of the volumes after 2 years</strong> is incorrect because RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is just a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple storage devices to achieve higher performance or data durability. RAID 0 can stripe multiple volumes together for greater I/O performance than you can achieve with a single volume. On the other hand, RAID 1 can mirror two volumes together to achieve on-instance redundancy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/lifecycle-management-efs.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/lifecycle-management-efs.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/API_LifecyclePolicy.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/API_LifecyclePolicy.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p>",

To accomplish this requirement, you can use AWS WAF web ACL. There are two types of rules in creating your own web ACL rule: regular and rate-based rules. You need to select the latter to add a rate limit to your web ACL. After creating the web ACL, you can associate it with ALB. When the rule action triggers, AWS WAF applies the action to additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Create a rate-based rule in AWS WAF and associate the web ACL to an Application Load Balancer.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Create a regular rule in AWS WAF and associate the web ACL to an Application Load Balancer </strong>is incorrect because a regular rule typically matches the statement defined in the rule. If you need to add a rate limit to your rule, you should create a rate-based rule.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Create a custom network ACL and associate it with the subnet of the Application Load Balancer to block the offending requests </strong>is incorrect. Although NACLs can help you block incoming traffic, this option wouldn't be able to limit the number of requests from a single IP address that is dynamically changing.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Create a custom rule in the security group of the Application Load Balancer to block the offending requests </strong>is incorrect because the security group can only allow incoming traffic. Remember that you can't deny traffic using security groups. In addition, it is not capable of limiting the rate of traffic to your application unlike AWS WAF.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-rate-based.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-rate-based.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/waf/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/waf/faqs/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS WAF Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-waf/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-waf/</a></p>",

You create a web ACL and define its protection strategy by adding rules. Rules define criteria for inspecting web requests and specify how to handle requests that match the criteria. You set a default action for the web ACL that indicates whether to block or allow through those requests that pass the rules inspections.</p><p><strong>-Rules</strong> – Each rule contains a statement that defines the inspection criteria and an action to take if a web request meets the criteria. When a web request meets the criteria, that's a match. You can configure rules to block matching requests, allow them through, count them, or run CAPTCHA controls against them.</p><p><strong>-Rules groups</strong> – You can use rules individually or in reusable rule groups. AWS Managed Rules and AWS Marketplace sellers provide managed rule groups for your use. You can also define your own rule groups.</p><p><strong>AWSManagedRulesSQLiRuleSet</strong> - The SQL database rule group contains rules to block request patterns associated with the exploitation of SQL databases, like SQL injection attacks.

AWS Network Firewall’s intrusion prevention system (IPS) provides active traffic flow inspection so you can identify and block vulnerability exploits using signature-based detection. AWS Network Firewall also offers web filtering that can stop traffic to known bad URLs and monitor fully qualified domain names.</p><p>In this scenario, you can use an egress-only internet gateway to allow outbound IPv6 communication to the internet and then use the AWS Network Firewall to set up the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer for the scenario is: <strong>Launch the EC2 instance to a private subnet and attach an Egress-Only Internet Gateway to the VPC to allow outbound IPv6 communication to the internet.

Use Amazon GuardDuty to set up the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering</strong> is incorrect because the AWS PrivateLink (which is also known as VPC Endpoint) is just a highly available, scalable technology that enables you to privately connect your VPC to the AWS services as if they were in your VPC. This service is not capable of controlling outbound IPv6 communication to the Internet. Furthermore, the Amazon GuardDuty service doesn't have the features to do traffic inspection or filtering.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Launch the EC2 instance to a public subnet and attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC to allow outbound IPv6 communication to the internet. Use Traffic Mirroring to set up the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering</strong> is incorrect because an Internet Gateway does not limit or control any outgoing IPv6 connection. Take note that the requirement is to prevent the Internet from initiating an inbound IPv6 connection to your instance. This solution allows all kinds of traffic to initiate a connection to your EC2 instance hence, this option is wrong. In addition, the use of Traffic Mirroring is not appropriate as well. This is just an Amazon VPC feature that you can use to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface of type interface, not to filter or inspect the incoming/outgoing traffic.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Launch the EC2 instance to a private subnet and attach a NAT Gateway to the VPC to allow outbound IPv6 communication to the internet.

When you deploy your application, Elastic Beanstalk builds the selected supported platform version and provisions one or more AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, to run your application.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/saa_elastic_beanstalk_deploy.png\"></p><p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk for .NET makes it easier to deploy, manage, and scale your ASP.NET web applications that use Amazon Web Services. Elastic Beanstalk for .NET is available to anyone who is developing or hosting a web application that uses IIS.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS for Oracle in a Multi-AZ deployment by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)</strong> is correct. AWS DMS can help migrate on-premises databases to the AWS Cloud.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Rehost the on-premises .NET application to an AWS Elastic Elastic Beanstalk Multi-AZ environment which runs in multiple Availability Zones</strong> is correct. AWS Beanstalk reduces the operational overhead by taking care of provisioning the needed resources for your application.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Refactor the application to .NET Core and run it as a serverless container service using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with AWS Fargate</strong> is incorrect. This will take significant changes to the application as you will refactor, or do a code change to, the codebase in order for it to become a serverless container application. Remember that the scenario explicitly mentioned that the migration process should minimize development changes. A better solution is to rehost the on-premises .NET application to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk Multi-AZ environment, which doesn't require any code changes.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) to migrate the on-premises Oracle database server to a new Amazon EC2 instance</strong> is incorrect. Amazon RDS supports standard Oracle databases so it would be better to use AWS DMS for the database migration, not AWS MGN.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Provision and replatform the application to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with Amazon EC2 worker nodes. Use the Windows Server Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and deploy the .NET application using to the ECS cluster via the Amazon ECS Anywhere service </strong>is incorrect. This may be possible but not recommended for this scenario because you will have to manage the underlying EC2 instances of your Amazon ECS cluster that will run the application. It would be better to use Elastic Beanstalk to take care of provisioning the resources for your .NET application. Keep in mind that doing a replatform-type migration like this one entails significant development changes, which is not suitable with the requirements given in the scenario.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_NET.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_NET.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out these AWS DMS and AWS Beanstalk Cheat Sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-database-migration-service/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-database-migration-service/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-elastic-beanstalk/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-elastic-beanstalk/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A company has recently migrated its microservices-based application to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). As part of the migration, the company must ensure that all sensitive configuration data and credentials, such as database passwords and API keys, are stored securely and encrypted within the Amazon EKS cluster's etcd key-value store.</p><p>What is the most suitable solution to meet the company's requirements?</p>",
    "multiple": true,

    "explanation": "<p>Enabling secret encryption with a new AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key in an existing Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster is critical to securing sensitive data stored in the cluster's etcd key-value store. Amazon EKS is a service for running and managing containerized applications, storing configuration data and secrets, etc., and is a distributed data store. By default, these secrets are not encrypted, posing potential security risks. Integrating AWS KMS with Amazon EKS allows for the encryption of these secrets, leveraging AWS KMS's capabilities to manage cryptographic keys and control their use across AWS services and applications.</p><p><img src=\" https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/Amazon-EKS-27072023.jpg\"></p><p>The process involves creating an AWS KMS key specifically for the EKS cluster and configuring the cluster to encrypt secrets before they are saved in etcd. This setup ensures that all sensitive information within the etcd database is encrypted at rest, enhancing data security. By adopting this approach, organizations can significantly improve their security posture, ensuring that sensitive data and credentials are protected according to industry standards and compliance requirements, thus maintaining data confidentiality and integrity within their Kubernetes environments.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Enable secret encryption with a new AWS KMS key on an existing Amazon EKS cluster to encrypt sensitive data stored in the EKS cluster's etcd key-value store.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use AWS Secrets Manager with a new AWS KMS key to securely manage and store sensitive data within the EKS cluster's etcd key-value store</strong> is incorrect. AWS Secrets Manager is a powerful tool for managing secrets but it doesn't directly address encrypting data within the etcd key-value store of an EKS cluster. Secrets Manager is more about managing and retrieving secrets rather than encrypting data within etcd.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Enable default Amazon EBS volume encryption for the account with a new AWS KMS key to ensure encryption of sensitive data within the Amazon EKS cluster</strong> is incorrect. Enabling default Amazon EBS volume encryption is a way to ensure that data at rest in EBS volumes is encrypted. However, the EBS volumes are primarily used for persistent storage of the worker nodes. They are not directly related to the storage of sensitive configuration data and credentials within the EKS cluster's etcd key-value store.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use Amazon EKS default options and the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver as an add-on to securely store sensitive data within the Amazon EKS cluster</strong> is incorrect. Amazon EBS CSI driver enables Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes as persistent storage for Kubernetes applications running on the Amazon EKS. While this can provide secure persistent storage for your microservices, it does not address the specific requirement of securely storing sensitive data within the EKS cluster's etcd key-value store.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/\">https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-kms.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-kms.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-eks/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-eks/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A Forex trading platform, which frequently processes and stores global financial data every minute, is hosted in an on-premises data center and uses an Oracle database. Due to a recent cooling problem in its data center, the company urgently needs to migrate its infrastructure to AWS to improve the performance of its applications. As the Solutions Architect, the responsibility is to ensure that the database is properly migrated and remains available in case of database server failure in the future.</p><p>Which combination of actions would meet the requirement? (Select TWO.)</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/con-multi-AZ.png\"></p><p>In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora) so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.</p><p>In this scenario, the best RDS configuration to use is an Oracle database in RDS with Multi-AZ deployments to ensure high availability even if the primary database instance goes down. You can use AWS DMS to move the on-premises database to AWS with minimal downtime and zero data loss. It supports over 20 engines, including Oracle to Aurora MySQL, MySQL to RDS for MySQL, SQL Server to Aurora PostgreSQL, MongoDB to DocumentDB, Oracle to Redshift, and S3.</p><p>Hence, the correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- Create an Oracle database in Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployments.</strong></p><p>- <strong>Migrate the Oracle database to AWS using the AWS Database Migration Service.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Launch an Oracle database instance in Amazon RDS with Recovery Manager (RMAN) enabled </strong>is incorrect because Oracle RMAN is not supported in RDS.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Convert the database schema using the AWS Schema Conversion Tool</strong> is incorrect. AWS Schema Conversion Tool is typically used for heterogeneous migrations where you're moving from one type of database to another (e.g., Oracle to PostgreSQL). In the scenario, the migration is homogenous, meaning it's an Oracle-to-Oracle migration. As a result, there's no need to convert the schema since you're staying within the same database type.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Migrate the Oracle database to a non-cluster Amazon Aurora with a single instance</strong> is incorrect. While a single-instance Aurora can be a feasible solution for non-critical applications or environments like development or testing, it is typically not suitable for applications that demand high availability.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dms/\">https://aws.amazon.com/dms/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon RDS Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-relational-database-service-amazon-rds/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-relational-database-service-amazon-rds/</a></p>",
