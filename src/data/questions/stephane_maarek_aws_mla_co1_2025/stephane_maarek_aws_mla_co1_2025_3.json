Customers who have either web or mobile applications with widespread users or applications hosted far away from their S3 bucket can experience long and variable upload and download speeds over the Internet. S3 Transfer Acceleration (S3TA) reduces the variability in internet routing, congestion and speeds that can affect transfers, and logically shortens the distance to S3 for remote applications.

Update the training job configuration to read data directly via the access point</strong> - Amazon S3 access points simplify data access for any AWS service or customer application that stores data in S3. Access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as GetObject and PutObject. This option acts as a distractor, since S3 access point cannot be used to enhance the training performance for the given use case."

Update the training job configuration to enhance the training performance by leveraging the accelerated data transfer</strong> - Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can speed up content transfers to and from Amazon S3 by as much as 50-500% for long-distance transfer of larger objects. Customers who have either web or mobile applications with widespread users or applications hosted far away from their S3 bucket can experience long and variable upload and download speeds over the Internet. S3 Transfer Acceleration (S3TA) reduces the variability in internet routing, congestion and speeds that can affect transfers, and logically shortens the distance to S3 for remote applications.

Policymakers, regulators, and advocates have raised awareness about the ethical and policy challenges posed by ML and data-driven systems. Amazon SageMaker Clarify can help you understand why your ML model made a specific prediction and whether this bias impacts this prediction during training or inference. SageMaker Clarify also provides tools that can help you build less biased and more understandable machine learning models. SageMaker Clarify can also generate model governance reports that you can provide to risk and compliance teams and external regulators. With SageMaker Clarify, you can do the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Detect bias in and help explain your model predictions.</p></li>\n<li><p>Identify types of bias in pre-training data.</p></li>\n<li><p>Identify types of bias in post-training data that can emerge during training or when your model is in production.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SageMaker Clarify helps explain how your models make predictions using feature attributions. It can also monitor inference models that are in production for both bias and feature attribution drift. This information can help you in the following areas:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Regulatory – Policymakers and other regulators can have concerns about discriminatory impacts of decisions that use output from ML models. For example, an ML model may encode bias and influence an automated decision.</p></li>\n<li><p>Business – Regulated domains may need reliable explanations for how ML models make predictions. Model explainability may be particularly important to industries that depend on reliability, safety, and compliance. These can include financial services, human resources, healthcare, and automated transportation. For example, lending applications may need to provide explanations about how ML models made certain predictions to loan officers, forecasters, and customers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Data Science – Data scientists and ML engineers can debug and improve ML models when they can determine if a model is making inferences based on noisy or irrelevant features. They can also understand the limitations of their models and failure modes that their models may encounter.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Fairness and explainability by design in the ML lifecycle:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-mla-pt/assets/pt3-q65-i1.jpg\" style=\"display: none;\"><span class=\"ud-component--base-components--open-full-size-image\"></span></p><div class=\"open-full-size-image--wrapper--R4gIm\" data-purpose=\"open-full-size-image\"><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-mla-pt/assets/pt3-q65-i1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"ud-btn ud-btn-medium ud-btn-link ud-heading-sm open-full-size-image--backdrop--Zor3j\"><svg aria-label=\"Larger image\" role=\"img\" focusable=\"false\" class=\"ud-icon ud-icon-large ud-icon-color-neutral\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-search\"></use></svg></button></div>\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-configure-processing-jobs.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-configure-processing-jobs.html</a><p></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor</strong> - Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor is designed to monitor deployed models for drift, bias, and data quality, but it does not directly address transparency, explainability, or regulatory compliance in the model development and decision-making process.

These metrics can be used to monitor the performance and health of the ML model.</p>\n\n<p>Lambda integrates natively with CloudWatch, allowing you to log custom metrics using the CloudWatch API from the AWS SDK. For example, you can use the putMetricData method to log performance metrics such as execution duration, memory usage, or invocation counts. Additionally, you can use the Lambda execution environment to automatically capture logs like errors or custom messages with console.log, which appear in the CloudWatch Logs console. These metrics and logs can then be visualized in dashboards, used to set up alarms for anomalies, or analyzed further to optimize your function's performance and cost efficiency. To implement this, ensure the Lambda function has the necessary IAM permissions to write to CloudWatch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up a CloudWatch alarm to send the email message</strong></p>\n\n<p>CloudWatch Alarms offer a native way to monitor metrics and automate notifications via Amazon SNS. Setting up a CloudWatch alarm to send an email message involves monitoring a specific metric and configuring Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) for email notifications. First, identify the metric you want to monitor and create an alarm in the CloudWatch console. During the alarm configuration, define the threshold conditions (e.g., metric value breaching a certain value) and the evaluation period. Next, create an SNS topic and subscribe the desired email addresses to this topic.

For example, you can use the putMetricData method to log performance metrics such as execution duration, memory usage, or invocation counts. Additionally, you can use the Lambda execution environment to automatically capture logs like errors or custom messages with console.log, which appear in the CloudWatch Logs console. These metrics and logs can then be visualized in dashboards, used to set up alarms for anomalies, or analyzed further to optimize your function's performance and cost efficiency. To implement this, ensure the Lambda function has the necessary IAM permissions to write to CloudWatch."

        "explanation": "CloudWatch Alarms offer a native way to monitor metrics and automate notifications via Amazon SNS. Setting up a CloudWatch alarm to send an email message involves monitoring a specific metric and configuring Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) for email notifications. First, identify the metric you want to monitor and create an alarm in the CloudWatch console. During the alarm configuration, define the threshold conditions (e.g., metric value breaching a certain value) and the evaluation period. Next, create an SNS topic and subscribe the desired email addresses to this topic. When setting up the alarm's actions, specify the SNS topic as the target for notifications when the alarm state changes (e.g., from OK to ALARM). Once configured, the alarm will automatically send email alerts to the subscribers whenever the specified condition is met (such as, for the given use case, the fraud detection model’s confidence score drops below a specific threshold of 80%), ensuring timely notifications about critical events or performance issues."

Autoscaling dynamically adjusts the number of instances provisioned for a model in response to changes in your workload. Unlike other hosted models Amazon SageMaker AI supports, with Asynchronous Inference you can also scale down your asynchronous endpoints instances to zero. Since the company does not want to manage the underlying infrastructure or its configuration, so this option is ruled out."

        "explanation": "<strong>Deploy the model using Amazon SageMaker Real-time Inference with auto scaling</strong> - Real-time inference is ideal for inference workloads where you have real-time, interactive, low latency requirements. To use auto scaling, you define a scaling policy that adds and removes the number of instances for your production variant in response to actual workloads. Since the company does not want to manage the underlying infrastructure or its configuration, so this option is ruled out."

Each instance has a webserver that provides low-latency responses to the requests</strong> - Amazon EC2 is a good choice for hosting because of its flexibility and the ability to provide a customizable environment. However, deploying the model on EC2 involves additional setup, configuration and maintenance which the company wants to avoid."

It then uses this relationship to predict the value of one of those factors based on the other. The prediction usually has a finite number of outcomes, like yes or no.</p>\n\n<p>For example, let’s say you want to guess if your website visitor will click the checkout button in their shopping cart or not. Logistic regression analysis looks at past visitor behavior, such as time spent on the website and the number of items in the cart. It determines that, in the past, if visitors spent more than five minutes on the site and added more than three items to the cart, they clicked the checkout button. Using this information, the logistic regression function can then predict the behavior of a new website visitor.</p>\n\n<p>Logistic regression is an important technique in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). ML models are software programs that you can train to perform complex data processing tasks without human intervention. ML models built using logistic regression help organizations gain actionable insights from their business data. They can use these insights for predictive analysis to reduce operational costs, increase efficiency, and scale faster.
