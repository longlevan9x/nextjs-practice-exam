These are observations which diverge from otherwise well-structured or patterned data. Anomalies can manifest as unexpected spikes in time series data, breaks in periodicity, or unclassifiable data points. They are easy to describe in that, when viewed in a plot, they are often easily distinguishable from the \"regular\" data. Including these anomalies in a data set can drastically increase the complexity of a machine learning task since the \"regular\" data can often be described with a simple model.</p>\n\n<p>Random Cut Forest (RCF) is specifically designed for detecting anomalies in data. This algorithm excels at identifying unexpected patterns in sensor data that could indicate the early stages of equipment failure.

These are observations which diverge from otherwise well-structured or patterned data. Anomalies can manifest as unexpected spikes in time series data, breaks in periodicity, or unclassifiable data points. They are easy to describe in that, when viewed in a plot, they are often easily distinguishable from the \"regular\" data. Including these anomalies in a data set can drastically increase the complexity of a machine learning task since the \"regular\" data can often be described with a simple model."
