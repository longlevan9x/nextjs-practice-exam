DynamoDB stores and retrieves each item based on the primary key value, which must be unique.</p><p>Items are distributed across 10-GB storage units, called partitions (physical storage internal to DynamoDB). Each table has one or more partitions, as shown in the following illustration.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-04-22_05-28-40-6b16884eef9101228e54e74b4de2613f.jpg\" style=\"display: none;\"><span class=\"ud-component--base-components--open-full-size-image\"></span></p><div class=\"open-full-size-image--wrapper--R4gIm\" data-purpose=\"open-full-size-image\"><img src=\"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-04-22_05-28-40-6b16884eef9101228e54e74b4de2613f.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"ud-btn ud-btn-medium ud-btn-link ud-heading-sm open-full-size-image--backdrop--Zor3j\"><svg aria-label=\"Larger image\" role=\"img\" focusable=\"false\" class=\"ud-icon ud-icon-large ud-icon-color-neutral\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-search\"></use></svg></button></div><p></p><p>DynamoDB uses the partition key’s value as an input to an internal hash function. The output from the hash function determines the partition in which the item is stored. Each item’s location is determined by the hash value of its partition key.</p><p>All items with the same partition key are stored together, and for composite partition keys, are ordered by the sort key value. DynamoDB splits partitions by sort key if the collection size grows bigger than 10 GB.</p><p>DynamoDB evenly distributes provisioned throughput—read capacity units (RCUs) and write capacity units (WCUs)—among partitions and automatically supports your access patterns using the throughput you have provisioned. However, if your access pattern exceeds 3000 RCU or 1000 WCU for a single partition key value, your requests might be throttled with a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException error.</p><p>To avoid request throttling, design your DynamoDB table with the right partition key to meet your access requirements and provide even distribution of data. Recommendations for doing this include the following:</p><p> • Use high cardinality attributes (e.g. email_id, employee_no, customer_id etc.)</p><p> • Use composite attributes</p><p> • Cache popular items</p><p> • Add random numbers or digits from a pre-determined range for write-heavy use cases</p><p>In this case there is a hot partition due to the order date being used as the partition key and this is causing writes to be throttled. Therefore, the best solution to ensure the writes are more evenly distributed in this scenario is to add a random number suffix to the partition key values.</p><p><strong>CORRECT: </strong>\"Add a random number suffix to the partition key values\" is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Increase the read and write capacity units for the table\" is incorrect as this will not solve the hot partition issue and we know that the consumed throughput is lower than provisioned throughput.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Add a global secondary index to the table\" is incorrect as a GSI is used for querying data more efficiently, it will not solve the problem of write performance due to a hot partition.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Use an Amazon SQS queue to buffer the incoming writes\" is incorrect as this is not the lowest cost option.

You can view statistical graphs of your published metrics with the AWS Management Console.</p><p>CloudWatch stores data about a metric as a series of data points. Each data point has an associated time stamp. You can even publish an aggregated set of data points called a <em>statistic set</em>.</p><p>Each metric is one of the following:</p><p> • Standard resolution, with data having a one-minute granularity</p><p> • High resolution, with data at a granularity of one second</p><p>Metrics produced by AWS services are standard resolution by default. When you publish a custom metric, you can define it as either standard resolution or high resolution. When you publish a high-resolution metric, CloudWatch stores it with a resolution of 1 second, and you can read and retrieve it with a period of 1 second, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or any multiple of 60 seconds.</p><p>High-resolution metrics can give you more immediate insight into your application's sub-minute activity. Keep in mind that every PutMetricData call for a custom metric is charged, so calling PutMetricData more often on a high-resolution metric can lead to higher charges.</p><p>Therefore, the best action to take is to Create custom metrics and configure them as high resolution.

KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events.</p><p>Server-side encryption is a feature in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams that automatically encrypts data before it's at rest by using an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) you specify. Data is encrypted before it's written to the Kinesis stream storage layer and decrypted after it’s retrieved from storage.

Your data is automatically encrypted as it enters and leaves the Kinesis Data Streams service, so your data at rest is encrypted.

By default, Amazon SQS uses <em>short polling</em>, querying only a subset of its servers (based on a weighted random distribution) to determine whether any messages are available for a response. You can use <em>long polling</em> to reduce your costs while allowing your consumers to receive messages as soon as they arrive in the queue.</p><p>When the wait time for the ReceiveMessage API action is greater than 0, <em>long polling</em> is in effect.

    "explanation": "<p>When you initialize a new service client without supplying any arguments, the AWS SDK for Java attempts to find AWS credentials by using the <em>default credential provider chain</em> implemented by the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/index.html?com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html\">DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain</a> class. The default credential provider chain looks for credentials in this order:</p><p><strong>&nbsp; 1. Environment variables</strong>–AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. The AWS SDK for Java uses the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/index.html?com/amazonaws/auth/EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider.html\">EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider</a> class to load these credentials.</p><p><strong> 2. Java system properties</strong>–aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey. The AWS SDK for Java uses the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/index.html?com/amazonaws/auth/SystemPropertiesCredentialsProvider.html\">SystemPropertiesCredentialsProvider</a> to load these credentials.</p><p><strong> 3. The default credential profiles file</strong>– typically located at ~/.aws/credentials (location can vary per platform) and shared by many of the AWS SDKs and by the AWS CLI. The AWS SDK for Java uses the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/index.html?com/amazonaws/auth/profile/ProfileCredentialsProvider.html\">ProfileCredentialsProvider</a> to load these credentials.</p><p><strong> 4. Amazon ECS container credentials</strong>– loaded from the Amazon ECS if the environment variable AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI is set. The AWS SDK for Java uses the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/index.html?com/amazonaws/auth/ContainerCredentialsProvider.html\">ContainerCredentialsProvider</a> to load these credentials. You can specify the IP address for this value.</p><p><strong> 5. Instance profile credentials</strong>– used on EC2 instances and delivered through the Amazon EC2 metadata service. The AWS SDK for Java uses the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/index.html?com/amazonaws/auth/InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider.html\">InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider</a> to load these credentials. You can specify the IP address for this value.</p><p>Therefore, the AWS SDK for Java will find the credentials stored in environment variables before it checks for instance provide credentials and will allow access to the extra S3 buckets.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Default Credential Provider Chain is very similar for other SDKs and the CLI as well. Check the references below for an article showing the steps for the AWS CLI.</p><p><strong>CORRECT: </strong>\"The AWS credential provider looks for instance profile credentials last\" is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"An IAM inline policy is being used on the IAM role\" is incorrect. If an inline policy was also applied to the role with a less restrictive policy it wouldn’t matter, as the most restrictive policy would be applied.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"An IAM managed policy is being used on the IAM role\" is incorrect. Though the managed policies are less restrictive by default (read-only or full access), this is not the most likely cause of the situation as we were told the policy is more restrictive and we know the environments variables have access keys in them which will be used before the policy is checked.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"The AWS CLI is corrupt and needs to be reinstalled\" is incorrect. There is a plausible explanation for this situation so no reason to suspect a software bug is to blame.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html</a></p>",
