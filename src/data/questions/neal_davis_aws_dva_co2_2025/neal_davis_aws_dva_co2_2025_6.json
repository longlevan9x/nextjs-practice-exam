With TTL enabled on a table, you can set a timestamp for deletion on a per-item basis, allowing you to limit storage usage to only those records that are relevant.</p><p>TTL is useful if you have continuously accumulating data that loses relevance after a specific time period (for example, session data, event logs, usage patterns, and other temporary data). If you have sensitive data that must be retained only for a certain amount of time according to contractual or regulatory obligations, TTL helps you ensure that it is removed promptly and as scheduled.</p><p>Therefore, the best answer is to enable the TTL attribute and add expiry timestamps to items.</p><p><strong>CORRECT: </strong>\"Enable the TTL attribute and add expiry timestamps to items\" is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Use atomic counters to decrement the data when it becomes stale\" is incorrect.

You can safely store the encrypted data key alongside the encrypted data.</p><p><strong> </strong>• <strong>Encrypting the same data under multiple master keys</strong></p><p>Encryption operations can be time consuming, particularly when the data being encrypted are large objects. Instead of re-encrypting raw data multiple times with different keys, you can re-encrypt only the data keys that protect the raw data.</p><p><strong> </strong>• <strong>Combining the strengths of multiple algorithms</strong></p><p>In general, symmetric key algorithms are faster and produce smaller ciphertexts than public key algorithms. But public key algorithms provide inherent separation of roles and easier key management.

If multiple hosts (or different threads on the same host) send messages with the same message group ID to a FIFO queue, Amazon SQS stores the messages in the order in which they arrive for processing. To ensure that Amazon SQS preserves the order in which messages are sent and received, ensure that each producer uses a unique message group ID to send all its messages.</p><p>FIFO queue logic applies only per message group ID. Each message group ID represents a distinct ordered message group within an Amazon SQS queue. For each message group ID, all messages are sent and received in strict order. However, messages with different message group ID values might be sent and received out of order. You must associate a message group ID with a message. If you don't provide a message group ID, the action fails. If you require a single group of ordered messages, provide the same message group ID for messages sent to the FIFO queue.</p><p>Therefore, the Developer can use a FIFO queue and configure the Lambda function to add a message deduplication token to the message body.

The message group ID is the tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are always processed one by one, in a strict order relative to the message group.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Send a <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> call with <code>VisibilityTimeout</code> set to 30 seconds after the receipt of every message from the queue\" is incorrect as this will just change the visibility timeout for the message which will prevent others from seeing it until it has been processed and deleted from the queue. This doesn’t stop a message with duplicate data being processed.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Configure a redrive policy, specify a destination Dead-Letter queue, and set the <code>maxReceiveCount </code>to 1\" is incorrect as without a FIFO queue and a message deduplication ID duplicate messages will still enter the queue.

Applications must sign their AWS API requests with AWS credentials, and this feature provides a strategy for managing credentials for your applications to use, similar to the way that Amazon EC2 instance profiles provide credentials to EC2 instances.</p><p>Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials to the containers or using the EC2 instance’s role, you can associate an IAM role with an ECS task definition or RunTask API operation. The applications in the task’s containers can then use the AWS SDK or CLI to make API requests to authorized AWS services.</p><p>Therefore, the most secure solution is to use a separate IAM role with the specific permissions required for an individual service and associate that role to the relevant ECS task definition. This should then be repeated for the remaining 5 services.</p><p><strong>CORRECT: </strong>\"Create six separate IAM roles, each containing the required permissions for the associated ECS service, then configure each ECS task definition to reference the associated IAM role\" is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Create six separate IAM roles, each containing the required permissions for the associated ECS service, then create an IAM group and configure the ECS cluster to reference that group\" is incorrect. The IAM role should be applied to the ECS task definition, not the ECS cluster.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Create a new Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance profile containing the required permissions for the various ECS services, then associate that instance role with the underlying EC2 instances\" is incorrect. With IAM Roles for Tasks you apply the permissions directly to the task definition. This means multiple services can share the underlying EC2 instance and only have the minimum privileges required.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Create a single IAM policy and use principal statements referencing the ECS tasks and assigning the required permissions, then apply the policy to the ECS service\" is incorrect. Identity-based policies attached to the ECS service can be used to control permissions for viewing, launching, and managing resources within ECS. However, for this solution we need to control the permissions for an ECS task to access other AWS services. For this we need to use IAM Roles for Tasks.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html</a></p><p><strong>Save time with our AWS cheat sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://digitalcloud.training/amazon-ec2/\">https://digitalcloud.training/amazon-ec2/</a></p>",

Similarly, when you scale down the task count, Amazon ECS must determine which tasks to terminate. You can apply task placement strategies and constraints to customize how Amazon ECS places and terminates tasks. Task placement strategies and constraints are not supported for tasks using the Fargate launch type. By default, Fargate tasks are spread across Availability Zones.</p><p>A <em>task placement strategy</em> is an algorithm for selecting instances for task placement or tasks for termination. For example, Amazon ECS can select instances at random, or it can select instances such that tasks are distributed evenly across a group of instances.</p><p>Amazon ECS supports the following task placement strategies:</p><p> • binpack</p><p>Place tasks based on the least available amount of CPU or memory.
