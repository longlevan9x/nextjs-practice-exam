For example, you can publish a new version of a function for beta testing without affecting users of the stable production version.

A Lambda alias is like a pointer to a specific Lambda function version. You can use routing configuration on an alias to send a portion of traffic to a Lambda function version.

        "explanation": "When you create a DynamoDB table, in addition to the table name, you must specify the primary key of the table. The primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table, so that no two items can have the same key.\nYou can create one or more secondary indexes on a table. A secondary index lets you query the data in the table using an alternate key, in addition to queries against the primary key. DynamoDB doesn't require that you use indexes, but they give your applications more flexibility when querying your data."

    "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use API Gateway Mapping Templates</strong> - In API Gateway, an API's method request can take a payload in a different format from the corresponding integration request payload, as required in the backend. Similarly, vice versa is also possible. API Gateway lets you use mapping templates to map the payload from a method request to the corresponding integration request and from an integration response to the corresponding method response.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose we have an API for managing fruit and vegetable inventory in the produce department of a supermarket.

    "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable API caching in API Gateway</strong></p>\n\n<p>API Gateway provides a few strategies for optimizing your API to improve responsiveness, like response caching and payload compression. You can enable API caching in Amazon API Gateway to cache your endpoint's responses. With caching, you can reduce the number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of requests to your API.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up usage plans and API keys in API Gateway</strong> - After you create, test, and deploy your APIs, you can use API Gateway usage plans to make them available as product offerings for your customers. You can configure usage plans and API keys to allow customers to access selected APIs, and begin throttling requests to those APIs based on defined limits and quotas. These can be set at the API, or API method level. This option is incorrect as usage plans and API keys cannot be used to improve the responsiveness of the API.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure API Gateway to use Elasticache for Memcached</strong> - This option has been added as a distractor. Elasticache for Memcached cannot be used with API Gateway to improve the responsiveness of the API for the given use case.

AWS CDK uses the familiarity and expressive power of programming languages such as JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET for modeling your applications. It provides you with high-level components called constructs that preconfigure cloud resources with proven defaults, so you can build cloud applications without needing to be an expert. AWS CDK provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS CloudFormation. It also enables you to compose and share your own custom constructs that incorporate your organization's requirements, helping you start new projects faster.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong> - When AWS CDK applications are run, they compile down to fully formed CloudFormation JSON/YAML templates that are then submitted to the CloudFormation service for provisioning. Because the AWS CDK leverages CloudFormation, you still enjoy all the benefits CloudFormation provides such as safe deployment, automatic rollback, and drift detection. But, CloudFormation by itself is not sufficient for the current use case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)</strong> - The AWS Serverless Application Repository is a managed repository for serverless applications. It enables teams, organizations, and individual developers to store and share reusable applications, and easily assemble and deploy serverless architectures in powerful new ways. Using the Serverless Application Repository, you don't need to clone, build, package, or publish source code to AWS before deploying it.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Serverless Application Model and AWS CDK both abstract AWS infrastructure as code making it easier for you to define your cloud infrastructure. If you prefer defining your serverless infrastructure in concise declarative templates, SAM is the better fit. If you want to define your AWS infrastructure in a familiar programming language, as is the requirement in the current use case, AWS CDK is the right fit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS CodeDeploy</strong> - AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and your on-premises servers. AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications. CodeDeploy can be used with AWS CDK for deployments.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/faqs/</a></p>\n",

        "explanation": "Provisioning cloud applications can be a challenging process that requires you to perform manual actions, write custom scripts, maintain templates, or learn domain-specific languages. AWS CDK uses the familiarity and expressive power of programming languages such as JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET for modeling your applications. It provides you with high-level components called constructs that preconfigure cloud resources with proven defaults, so you can build cloud applications without needing to be an expert. AWS CDK provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS CloudFormation. It also enables you to compose and share your own custom constructs that incorporate your organization's requirements, helping you start new projects faster."

The SCP limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including each AWS account root user. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Access control list (ACL)</strong> - Access control lists (ACLs) are service policies that allow you to control which principals in another account can access a resource. ACLs cannot be used to control access for a principal within the same account.

A permissions boundary is an advanced feature for using a managed policy to set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity.

That's because the number of messages in your SQS queue does not solely define the number of instances needed. The number of instances in your Auto Scaling group can be driven by multiple factors, including how long it takes to process a message and the acceptable amount of latency (queue delay).</p>\n\n<p>The solution is to use a backlog per instance metric with the target value being the acceptable backlog per instance to maintain. You can calculate these numbers as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Backlog per instance: To calculate your backlog per instance, start with the ApproximateNumberOfMessages queue attribute to determine the length of the SQS queue (number of messages available for retrieval from the queue). Divide that number by the fleet's running capacity, which for an Auto Scaling group is the number of instances in the InService state, to get the backlog per instance.</p>\n\n<p>Acceptable backlog per instance: To calculate your target value, first determine what your application can accept in terms of latency. Then, take the acceptable latency value and divide it by the average time that an EC2 instance takes to process a message.</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate with an example, let's say that the current ApproximateNumberOfMessages is 1500 and the fleet's running capacity is 10. If the average processing time is 0.1 seconds for each message and the longest acceptable latency is 10 seconds, then the acceptable backlog per instance is 10 / 0.1, which equals 100. This means that 100 is the target value for your target tracking policy. If the backlog per instance is currently at 150 (1500 / 10), your fleet scales out, and it scales out by five instances to maintain proportion to the target value.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Docker swarm</strong> - A Docker swarm is a container orchestration tool, meaning that it allows the user to manage multiple containers deployed across multiple host machines. A swarm consists of multiple Docker hosts which run in swarm mode and act as managers (to manage membership and delegation) and workers (which run swarm services).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use ECS service scheduler</strong> - Amazon ECS provides a service scheduler (for long-running tasks and applications), the ability to run tasks manually (for batch jobs or single run tasks), with Amazon ECS placing tasks on your cluster for you. You can specify task placement strategies and constraints that allow you to run tasks in the configuration you choose, such as spread out across Availability Zones. It is also possible to integrate with custom or third-party schedulers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use ECS step scaling policy</strong> - Although Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling supports using Application Auto Scaling step scaling policies, AWS recommends using target tracking scaling policies instead. For example, if you want to scale your service when CPU utilization falls below or rises above a certain level, create a target tracking scaling policy based on the CPU utilization metric provided by Amazon ECS.</p>\n\n<p>With step scaling policies, you create and manage the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process.

    "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR)</strong> - The AWS Serverless Application Repository is a managed repository for serverless applications. It enables teams, organizations, and individual developers to store and share reusable applications, and easily assemble and deploy serverless architectures in powerful new ways. Using the Serverless Application Repository, you don't need to clone, build, package, or publish source code to AWS before deploying it. Instead, you can use pre-built applications from the Serverless Application Repository in your serverless architectures, helping you and your teams reduce duplicated work, ensure organizational best practices, and get to market faster. Integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides resource-level control of each application, enabling you to publicly share applications with everyone or privately share them with specific AWS accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Deploying applications using SAR:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt6-q6-i1.jpg\" style=\"display: none;\"><span class=\"ud-component--base-components--open-full-size-image\"></span></p><div class=\"open-full-size-image--wrapper--R4gIm\" data-purpose=\"open-full-size-image\"><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt6-q6-i1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"ud-btn ud-btn-medium ud-btn-link ud-heading-sm open-full-size-image--backdrop--Zor3j\"><svg aria-label=\"Larger image\" role=\"img\" focusable=\"false\" class=\"ud-icon ud-icon-large ud-icon-color-neutral\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-search\"></use></svg></button></div>\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/\">https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/</a><p></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Marketplace</strong> - The AWS Marketplace enables qualified partners to market and sell their software to AWS Customers.
