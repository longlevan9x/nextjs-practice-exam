It works by storing objects in two access tiers: one tier that is optimized for frequent access and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequent access.\n\nFor a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object, Amazon S3 monitors access patterns of the objects in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering and moves the ones that have not been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed, it is automatically moved back to the frequent access tier. There are no retrieval fees when using the Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class, and no additional tiering fees when objects are moved between access tiers. It is the ideal storage class for long-lived data with access patterns that are unknown or unpredictable.\n\nAmazon S3 Storage Classes can be configured at the object level and a single bucket can contain objects stored in Amazon S3 Standard, Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering, Amazon S3 Standard-IA, and Amazon S3 One Zone-IA. You can upload objects directly to Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering, or use S3 Lifecycle policies to transfer objects from Amazon S3 Standard and Amazon S3 Standard-IA to Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering. You can also archive objects from Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering to Amazon S3 Glacier.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nConfigure Amazon EFS to provide a fast, cost-effective and sharable storage service - Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. Amazon EFS offers sharable service, unlike Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) that cannot be shared by instances. Amazon EFS is costlier than storing data in Amazon S3. Also, Amazon EFS needs an Amazon EC2 instance or an AWS Direct Connect network connection. Hence, this is not the correct option.\n\nUse Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access, to reduce the costs on Amazon S3 storage - Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. Unlike other Amazon S3 Storage Classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs), Amazon S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than Amazon S3 Standard-IA. Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data but do not require the availability and resilience of Amazon S3 Standard or Amazon S3 Standard-IA. Not a right option, since data stored is business-critical and cannot be risked by using Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.\n\nUse Amazon S3 Outposts storage class to reduce the costs on Amazon S3 storage by storing the data on-premises - This is a distractor as Amazon S3 on Outposts (S3 Outposts) delivers object storage to your on-premises AWS Outposts environment. It is used in conjunction with AWS Outposts and has no relevance to the current use case.\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/",

When you configure a bucket as a static website, you must enable website hosting, set permissions, and create and add an index document. Depending on your website requirements, you can also configure redirects, web traffic logging, and a custom error document.\n\nAfter you configure your bucket as a static website, you can access the bucket through the AWS Region-specific Amazon S3 website endpoints for your bucket. Website endpoints are different from the endpoints where you send REST API requests. Amazon S3 doesn't support HTTPS access for website endpoints. If you want to use HTTPS, you can use CloudFront to serve a static website hosted on Amazon S3.\n\nYou can use Amazon CloudFront to improve the performance of your website. CloudFront makes your website files (such as HTML, images, and video) available from data centers around the world (called edge locations).

This results in faster download times than if the visitor had requested the content from a data center that is located farther away.\n\nAmazon CloudFront caches content at edge locations for a period of time that you specify. If a visitor requests content that has been cached for longer than the expiration date, Amazon CloudFront checks the origin server to see if a newer version of the content is available.

    "domain": "Design Cost-Optimized Architectures",
    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nUse Amazon EC2 instances with Instance Store as the storage option\n\nAn instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. Some instance types use NVMe or SATA-based solid-state drives (SSD) to deliver high random I/O performance. This is a good option when you need storage with very low latency, but you don't need the data to persist when the instance terminates or you can take advantage of fault-tolerant architectures.\n\nAs Instance Store delivers high random I/O performance, it can act as a temporary storage space, and these volumes are included as part of the instance's usage cost, therefore this is the correct option.\n\nAmazon EC2 Instance Store: \n via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nUse Amazon EC2 instances with Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) as the storage option - General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for a broad range of workloads. These volumes deliver single-digit millisecond latencies and the ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS for extended periods. Between a minimum of 100 IOPS (at 33.33 GiB and below) and a maximum of 16,000 IOPS (at 5,334 GiB and above), baseline performance scales linearly at 3 IOPS per GiB of volume size. AWS designs gp2 volumes to deliver its provisioned performance 99% of the time. A gp2 volume can range in size from 1 GiB to 16 TiB. Amazon EBS gp2 is persistent storage and costlier than Instance Stores (the cost of the storage volume is in addition to that of the Amazon EC2 instance), therefore this option is not correct.\n\nUse Amazon EC2 instances with Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) as the storage option - Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads, that are sensitive to storage performance and consistency.

        "explanation": "An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. Some instance types use NVMe or SATA-based solid-state drives (SSD) to deliver high random I/O performance. This is a good option when you need storage with very low latency, but you don't need the data to persist when the instance terminates or you can take advantage of fault-tolerant architectures."

A NAT gateway has the following characteristics and limitations:\n\nA NAT gateway supports 5 Gbps of bandwidth and automatically scales up to 45 Gbps.\nYou can associate exactly one Elastic IP address with a NAT gateway.\nA NAT gateway supports the following protocols: TCP, UDP, and ICMP.\nYou cannot associate a security group with a NAT gateway.\nYou can use a network access control list (network ACL) to control the traffic to and from the subnet in which the NAT gateway is located.\nA NAT gateway can support up to 55,000 simultaneous connections to each unique destination.\n\nTherefore you must use a NAT Gateway in your public subnet in order to provide internet access to your instances in your private subnets. You are charged for creating and using a NAT gateway in your account. NAT gateway hourly usage and data processing rates apply.\n\nComparison of NAT instances and NAT gateways: \n via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-comparison.html\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nNAT Instances deployed in your public subnet - You can use a network address translation (NAT) instance in a public subnet in your VPC to enable instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the instances from receiving inbound traffic initiated by someone on the Internet. Amazon provides Amazon Linux AMIs that are configured to run as NAT instances. These AMIs include the string amzn-ami-vpc-nat in their names, so you can search for them in the Amazon EC2 console. NAT Instances would work but won't scale and you would have to manage them (as they're nothing but Amazon EC2 instances).\n\nInternet Gateways deployed in your private subnet - An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It, therefore, imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic. Internet Gateways must be deployed in a public subnet, hence not an option here.\n\nEgress-Only Internet Gateways deployed in your private subnet - An Egress-Only Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the Internet, and prevents the Internet from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instances. Egress-Only Internet Gateways are for IPv6, not IPv4.

It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.\n\nIf your application is composed of several individual services, an Application Load Balancer can route a request to a service based on the content of the request.\n\nHere are the different types -\n\nHost-based Routing: You can route a client request based on the Host field of the HTTP header allowing you to route to multiple domains from the same load balancer. You can use host conditions to define rules that route requests based on the hostname in the host header (also known as host-based routing). This enables you to support multiple domains using a single load balancer. Example hostnames: example.com test.example.com *.example.com The rule *.example.com matches test.example.com but doesn't match example.com.\n\nPath-based Routing: You can route a client request based on the URL path of the HTTP header. You can use path conditions to define rules that route requests based on the URL in the request (also known as path-based routing). Example path patterns: /img/* /img//pics The path pattern is used to route requests but does not alter them. For example, if a rule has a path pattern of /img/, the rule would forward a request for /img/picture.jpg to the specified target group as a request for /img/picture.jpg. The path pattern is applied only to the path of the URL, not to its query parameters.\n\nHTTP header-based routing: You can route a client request based on the value of any standard or custom HTTP header.\n\nHTTP method-based routing: You can route a client request based on any standard or custom HTTP method.\n\nQuery string parameter-based routing: You can route a client request based on query string or query parameters.\n\nSource IP address CIDR-based routing: You can route a client request based on source IP address CIDR from where the request originates.\n\nPath based routing and host based routing are only available for the Application Load Balancer (ALB). Therefore this is the correct option for the given use-case.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nCreate an NGINX based load balancer on an Amazon EC2 instance to have advanced routing capabilities - Although it is technically possible to set up NGINX based load balancer, however, this option involves a lot of configuration effort, so this option is ruled out for the given use-case. So, deploying an NGINX load balancer on Amazon EC2 would work but would suffer management and scaling issues.\n\nCreate a Network Load Balancer - Network Load Balancer is best suited for use-cases involving low latency and high throughput workloads that involve scaling to millions of requests per second. Network Load Balancer operates at the connection level (Layer 4), routing connections to targets - Amazon EC2 instances, microservices, and containers – within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) based on IP protocol data.\n\nCreate a Classic Load Balancer - Classic Load Balancer provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances and operates at both the request level and connection level. Classic Load Balancer is intended for applications that were built within the EC2-Classic network.\n\nAs mentioned in the description above, these two options are incorrect for the given use-case.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-listeners.html\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-host-based-routing-support-for-aws-application-load-balancers/",

Amazon ElastiCache allows you to seamlessly set up, run, and scale popular open-Source compatible in-memory data stores in the cloud. Session stores can be set up using both Memcached or Redis for ElastiCache.\n\nAmazon ElastiCache for Redis is a great choice for real-time transactional and analytical processing use cases such as caching, chat/messaging, gaming leaderboards, geospatial, machine learning, media streaming, queues, real-time analytics, and session store.\n\nAmazon ElastiCache for Memcached is a Memcached-compatible in-memory key-value store service that can be used as a cache or a data store. Session stores are easy to create with Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached.\n\nHow Amazon ElastiCache Works: \n via - https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nUse Amazon RDS for distributed in-memory cache based session management - Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It cannot be used as a distributed in-memory cache for session management, hence this option is incorrect.\n\nUse Amazon DynamoDB for distributed in-memory cache based session management - Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database and is not the right fit for a distributed in-memory cache-based session management solution.\n\nUse Application Load Balancer sticky sessions - Although sticky sessions enable each user to interact with one server and one server only, however, in case of an unhealthy server, all the session data is gone as well. Therefore Amazon Elasticache powered distributed in-memory cache-based session management is a better solution.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/building-fast-session-caching-with-amazon-elasticache-for-redis/\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/",

    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nEnable an Amazon Route 53 health check\n\nDetermining the health of an ELB endpoint is more complex than health checking a single IP address. For example, what if your application is running fine on Amazon EC2, but the load balancer itself isn't reachable? Or if your load balancer and your Amazon EC2 instances are working correctly, but a bug in your code causes your application to crash? Or how about if the Amazon EC2 instances in one Availability Zone of a multi-AZ ELB are experiencing problems?\n\nAmazon Route 53 DNS Failover handles all of these failure scenarios by integrating with ELB behind the scenes. Once enabled, Route 53 automatically configures and manages health checks for individual ELB nodes. Amazon Route 53 also takes advantage of the Amazon EC2 instance health checking that ELB performs (information on configuring your ELB health checks is available here). By combining the results of health checks of your Amazon EC2 instances and your ELBs, Amazon Route 53 DNS Failover can evaluate the health of the load balancer and the health of the application running on the Amazon EC2 instances behind it. In other words, if any part of the stack goes down, Amazon Route 53 detects the failure and routes traffic away from the failed endpoint.\n\nUsing Amazon Route 53 DNS Failover, you can run your primary application simultaneously in multiple AWS regions around the world and failover across regions. Your end-users will be routed to the closest (by latency), healthy region for your application. Amazon Route 53 automatically removes from service any region where your application is unavailable - it will pull an endpoint out of service if there is region-wide connectivity or operational issue, if your application goes down in that region, or if your ELB or Amazon EC2 instances go down in that region.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nEnable an ALB health check - ELB health check verifies that a specified TCP port on an instance is accepting connections or a specified page has returned an error code of 200. It is not useful for the given failover scenario.\n\nEnable an Amazon EC2 instance health check - Instance status checks monitor the software and network configuration of your instance. It is not intelligent enough to understand if the application on the instance is working correctly.

For example, what if your application is running fine on Amazon EC2, but the load balancer itself isn't reachable? Or if your load balancer and your Amazon EC2 instances are working correctly, but a bug in your code causes your application to crash? Or how about if the Amazon EC2 instances in one Availability Zone of a multi-AZ ELB are experiencing problems?"

        "answer": "",
        "explanation": "Amazon Route 53 DNS Failover handles all of these failure scenarios by integrating with ELB behind the scenes. Once enabled, Route 53 automatically configures and manages health checks for individual ELB nodes. Amazon Route 53 also takes advantage of the Amazon EC2 instance health checking that ELB performs (information on configuring your ELB health checks is available here). By combining the results of health checks of your Amazon EC2 instances and your ELBs, Amazon Route 53 DNS Failover can evaluate the health of the load balancer and the health of the application running on the Amazon EC2 instances behind it. In other words, if any part of the stack goes down, Amazon Route 53 detects the failure and routes traffic away from the failed endpoint."

        "explanation": "Using Amazon Route 53 DNS Failover, you can run your primary application simultaneously in multiple AWS regions around the world and failover across regions. Your end-users will be routed to the closest (by latency), healthy region for your application. Amazon Route 53 automatically removes from service any region where your application is unavailable - it will pull an endpoint out of service if there is region-wide connectivity or operational issue, if your application goes down in that region, or if your ELB or Amazon EC2 instances go down in that region."

To create a scheduled scaling action, you specify the start time when the scaling action should take effect, and the new minimum, maximum, and desired sizes for the scaling action.

        "answer": "",
        "explanation": "When a host needs to send many records per second (RPS) to Amazon Kinesis, simply calling the basic PutRecord API action in a loop is inadequate. To reduce overhead and increase throughput, the application must batch records and implement parallel HTTP requests. This will increase the efficiency overall and ensure you are optimally using the shards."
