    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nUse an Auto Scaling Group\n\nAn Auto Scaling group (ASG) contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies. Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service.\n\nThe size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.\n\nAn Auto Scaling group starts by launching enough instances to meet its desired capacity. It maintains this number of instances by performing periodic health checks on the instances in the group. The Auto Scaling group continues to maintain a fixed number of instances even if an instance becomes unhealthy. If an instance becomes unhealthy, the group terminates the unhealthy instance and launches another instance to replace it.\n\nAuto Scaling group is the correct answer here.\n\nIncorrect option:\n\nUse an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of your website - Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment. You can use Amazon CloudFront to improve the performance of your website. Amazon CloudFront makes your website files (such as HTML, images, and video) available from data centers around the world (called edge locations). When a visitor requests a file from your website, CloudFront automatically redirects the request to a copy of the file at the nearest edge location. This results in faster download times than if the visitor had requested the content from a data center that is located farther away.\n\nAmazon CloudFront is not a good solution here as the content is highly dynamic, and Amazon CloudFront will cache things.\n\nDeploy the website on Amazon S3 - You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website. On a static website, individual web pages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts. To host a static website on Amazon S3, you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload your website content to the bucket. When you configure a bucket as a static website, you enable static website hosting, set permissions, and add an index document. Depending on your website requirements, you can also configure other options, including redirects, web traffic logging, and custom error documents.\n\nDynamic applications cannot be deployed to Amazon S3. This option has been added as a distractor.\n\nUse an Amazon Route 53 Multi Value record - Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Use Multi Value answer routing policy when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random. Amazon Route 53 does not help in scaling your application. This option has been added as a distractor.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html",

It delivers high performance and availability with up to 15 low-latency read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across three Availability Zones (AZs).\n\nAurora Replicas are independent endpoints in an Aurora DB cluster, best used for scaling read operations. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability Zones (AZs) that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region. The DB cluster volume is made up of multiple copies of the data for the DB cluster. However, the data in the cluster volume is represented as a single, logical volume to the primary instance and Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. You can also set up two Aurora MySQL DB clusters in different AWS Regions, by creating an Aurora Read Replica of an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster in a different AWS Region. In this way, Aurora Read Replicas can be deployed globally.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nUse Amazon Aurora Multi-AZ - Aurora, stores copies of the data in a DB cluster across multiple Availability Zones in a single AWS Region, regardless of whether the instances in the DB cluster span multiple Availability Zones (AZs). When data is written to the primary DB instance, Aurora synchronously replicates the data across Availability Zones (AZs) to six storage nodes associated with your cluster volume. Doing so provides data redundancy, eliminates I/O freezes, and minimizes latency spikes during system backups. Always remember that the main purpose for multi-AZ is high availability whereas the main purpose of read replicas is read scalability.\n\nUse Amazon DynamoDB Streams - Amazon DynamoDB Streams is a powerful service that you can combine with other AWS services to solve many problems. When enabled, DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in a DynamoDB table and durably stores the information for up to 24 hours. Applications can access a series of stream records, which contain an item change, from a DynamoDB stream in near real-time.\n\nCreate an AWS Lambda function to periodically back up and restore the Amazon Aurora database in another region - AWS Lambda can be used to create backups for Amazon RDS.

    "explanation": "Correct options:\n\nCopy data from the source bucket to the destination bucket using the aws S3 sync command\n\nThe aws S3 sync command uses the CopyObject APIs to copy objects between Amazon S3 buckets. The sync command lists the source and target buckets to identify objects that are in the source bucket but that aren't in the target bucket. The command also identifies objects in the source bucket that have different LastModified dates than the objects that are in the target bucket. The sync command on a versioned bucket copies only the current version of the object—previous versions aren't copied. By default, this preserves object metadata, but the access control lists (ACLs) are set to FULL_CONTROL for your AWS account, which removes any additional ACLs. If the operation fails, you can run the sync command again without duplicating previously copied objects.\n\nYou can use the command like so:\n\naws s3 sync s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-SOURCE s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-TARGET\n\nSet up Amazon S3 batch replication to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in another Region using S3 console and then delete the replication configuration\n\nAmazon S3 Batch Replication provides you a way to replicate objects that existed before a replication configuration was in place, objects that have previously been replicated, and objects that have failed replication. This is done through the use of a Batch Operations job.\n\nYou should note that batch replication differs from live replication which continuously and automatically replicates new objects across Amazon S3 buckets. You cannot directly use the AWS S3 console to configure cross-Region replication for existing objects. By default, replication only supports copying new Amazon S3 objects after it is enabled using the AWS S3 console. Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts. Object may be replicated to a single destination bucket or multiple destination buckets. Destination buckets can be in different AWS Regions or within the same Region as the source bucket. Once done, you can delete the replication configuration, as it ensures that batch replication is only used for this one-time data copy operation.\n\nIf you want to enable live replication for existing objects for your bucket, you must contact AWS Support and raise a support ticket. This is required to ensure that replication is configured correctly.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nUse AWS Snowball Edge device to copy the data from one Region to another Region - As the given requirement is about copying the data from one AWS Region to another AWS Region, so AWS Snowball Edge cannot be used here. AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal data transfer choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. You can use AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized if you have a large backlog of data to transfer or if you frequently collect data that needs to be transferred to AWS and your storage is in an area where high-bandwidth internet connections are not available or cost-prohibitive. AWS Snowball Edge can operate in remote locations or harsh operating environments, such as factory floors, oil and gas rigs, mining sites, hospitals, and on moving vehicles.\n\nCopy data from the source Amazon S3 bucket to a target Amazon S3 bucket using the S3 console - AWS S3 console cannot be used to copy 1 petabytes of data from one bucket to another as it's not feasible. You should note that this option is different from using the replication options on the AWS console, since here you are using the copy and paste options provided on the AWS console, which is suggested for small or medium data volume. You should use S3 sync for the requirement of one-time copy of data.\n\nSet up Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in different Regions using S3 console - Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an Amazon S3 bucket. You cannot use Transfer Acceleration to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in different Regions using Amazon S3 console.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/move-objects-s3-bucket/\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/snowball/faqs/\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html",

Object may be replicated to a single destination bucket or multiple destination buckets. Destination buckets can be in different AWS Regions or within the same Region as the source bucket. Once done, you can delete the replication configuration, as it ensures that batch replication is only used for this one-time data copy operation."

    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nPilot Light\n\nThe term pilot light is often used to describe a DR scenario in which a minimal version of an environment is always running in the cloud. The idea of the pilot light is an analogy that comes from the gas heater. In a gas heater, a small flame that’s always on can quickly ignite the entire furnace to heat up a house. This scenario is similar to a backup-and-restore scenario. For example, with AWS you can maintain a pilot light by configuring and running the most critical core elements of your system in AWS. For the given use-case, a small part of the backup infrastructure is always running simultaneously syncing mutable data (such as databases or documents) so that there is no loss of critical data. When the time comes for recovery, you can rapidly provision a full-scale production environment around the critical core. For Pilot light, RPO/RTO is in 10s of minutes, so this is the correct solution.\n\nFour Disaster Recovery scenarios: \n via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/plan-for-disaster-recovery-dr.html\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nBackup and Restore - In most traditional environments, data is backed up to tape and sent off-site regularly. If you use this method, it can take a long time to restore your system in the event of a disruption or disaster. Amazon S3 is an ideal destination for backup data that might be needed quickly to perform a restore. Transferring data to and from Amazon S3 is typically done through the network and is therefore accessible from any location. There are many commercial and open-source backup solutions that integrate with Amazon S3. You can use AWS Import/Export to transfer very large data sets by shipping storage devices directly to AWS. For longer-term data storage where retrieval times of several hours are adequate, there is Amazon Glacier, which has the same durability model as Amazon S3. Amazon Glacier is a low-cost alternative starting from $0.01/GB per month. Amazon Glacier and Amazon S3 can be used in conjunction to produce a tiered backup solution. Even though Backup and Restore method is cheaper, it has an RPO in hours, so this option is not the right fit.\n\nWarm Standby - The term warm standby is used to describe a DR scenario in which a scaled-down version of a fully functional environment is always running in the cloud. A warm standby solution extends the pilot light elements and preparation. It further decreases the recovery time because some services are always running. By identifying your business-critical systems, you can fully duplicate these systems on AWS and have them always on. This option is costlier compared to Pilot Light.\n\nMulti-Site - A multi-site solution runs on AWS as well as on your existing on-site infrastructure in an active-active configuration. The data replication method that you employ will be determined by the recovery point that you choose, either Recovery Time Objective (the maximum allowable downtime before degraded operations are restored) or Recovery Point Objective (the maximum allowable time window whereby you will accept the loss of transactions during the DR process). This option is more costly compared to Pilot Light.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/rapidly-recover-mission-critical-systems-in-a-disaster/\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/plan-for-disaster-recovery-dr.html\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/disaster-recovery-dr-objectives.html",

    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nGeoproximity routing\n\nGeoproximity routing lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources. You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. A bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource.\n\nTo optionally change the size of the geographic region from which Amazon Route 53 routes traffic to a resource, specify the applicable value for the bias: 1. To expand the size of the geographic region from which Amazon Route 53 routes traffic to a resource, specify a positive integer from 1 to 99 for the bias. Amazon Route 53 shrinks the size of adjacent regions.\n\nTo shrink the size of the geographic region from which Amazon Route 53 routes traffic to a resource, specify a negative bias of -1 to -99. Amazon Route 53 expands the size of adjacent regions.\n\nMore on how bias works in Geoproximity routing: \n via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nGeolocation routing - Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users, meaning the location that DNS queries originate from. For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer in the Frankfurt region.\n\nWhen you use geolocation routing, you can localize your content and present some or all of your website in the language of your users. You can also use geolocation routing to restrict the distribution of content to only the locations in which you have distribution rights. Another possible use is for balancing load across endpoints in a predictable, easy-to-manage way so that each user location is consistently routed to the same endpoint.\n\nLatency-based routing - If your application is hosted in multiple AWS Regions, you can improve performance for your users by serving their requests from the AWS Region that provides the lowest latency.\n\nTo use latency-based routing, you create latency records for your resources in multiple AWS Regions. When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for your domain or subdomain (example.com or acme.example.com), it determines which AWS Regions you've created latency records for, determines which region gives the user the lowest latency, and then selects a latency record for that region. Amazon Route 53 responds with the value from the selected record, such as the IP address for a web server.\n\nWeighted routing - Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of software.\n\nTo configure weighted routing, you create records that have the same name and type for each of your resources. You assign each record a relative weight that corresponds with how much traffic you want to send to each resource. Amazon Route 53 sends traffic to a resource based on the weight that you assign to the record as a proportion of the total weight for all records in the group.\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html",

      }
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nSet up Amazon DynamoDB table in the on-demand capacity mode\n\nAmazon DynamoDB has two read/write capacity modes for processing reads and writes on your tables:\n\nOn-demand\n\nProvisioned (default, free-tier eligible)\n\nAmazon DynamoDB on-demand is a flexible billing option capable of serving thousands of requests per second without capacity planning. DynamoDB on-demand offers pay-per-request pricing for read and write requests so that you pay only for what you use.\n\nThe on-demand mode is a good option if any of the following are true:\n\nYou create new tables with unknown workloads.\n\nYou have unpredictable application traffic.\n\nYou prefer the ease of paying for only what you use.\n\nIf you choose provisioned mode, you specify the number of reads and writes per second that you require for your application. You can use auto-scaling to adjust your table’s provisioned capacity automatically in response to traffic changes. This helps you govern your DynamoDB use to stay at or below a defined request rate to obtain cost predictability.\n\nProvisioned mode is a good option if any of the following are true:\n\nYou have predictable application traffic.\n\nYou run applications whose traffic is consistent or ramps gradually.\n\nYou can forecast capacity requirements to control costs.\n\n via - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-dynamodb-auto-scaling-performance-and-cost-optimization-at-any-scale/\n\nWith on-demand, Amazon DynamoDB instantly allocates capacity as it is needed. There is no concept of provisioned capacity, and there is no delay waiting for Amazon CloudWatch thresholds or the subsequent table updates. On-demand is ideal for bursty, new, or unpredictable workloads whose traffic can spike in seconds or minutes, and when underprovisioned capacity would impact the user experience. On-demand is a perfect solution if your team is moving to a NoOps or serverless environment.\n\nThe given use case clearly states that when the traffic spikes occur they happen very quickly, thereby implying an unpredictable traffic pattern, therefore the on-demand capacity mode is the correct option for the given use case.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nSet up Amazon DynamoDB table in the provisioned capacity mode with auto-scaling enabled - As mentioned in the explanation above, you should use the provisioned capacity mode (even with auto-scaling) only when you have predictable application traffic.\n\nWhen you create Amazon DynamoDB table, auto-scaling is the default capacity setting, but you can also enable auto-scaling on any table that does not have it active. Behind the scenes, as illustrated in the following diagram, DynamoDB auto scaling uses a scaling policy in Application Auto Scaling. To configure auto-scaling in DynamoDB, you set the minimum and maximum levels of read and write capacity in addition to the target utilization percentage. Auto-scaling uses Amazon CloudWatch to monitor a table’s read and write capacity metrics. To do so, it creates CloudWatch alarms that track consumed capacity.\n\nSet up Amazon DynamoDB table with a global secondary index - A global secondary index (GSI) is an index with a partition key and a sort key that can be different from those on the base table. A global secondary index is considered \"global\" because queries on the index can span all of the data in the base table, across all partitions. A global secondary index is stored in its own partition space away from the base table and scales separately from the base table.

        "explanation": "When you create Amazon DynamoDB table, auto-scaling is the default capacity setting, but you can also enable auto-scaling on any table that does not have it active. Behind the scenes, as illustrated in the following diagram, DynamoDB auto scaling uses a scaling policy in Application Auto Scaling. To configure auto-scaling in DynamoDB, you set the minimum and maximum levels of read and write capacity in addition to the target utilization percentage. Auto-scaling uses Amazon CloudWatch to monitor a table’s read and write capacity metrics. To do so, it creates CloudWatch alarms that track consumed capacity."

By identifying your business-critical systems, you can fully duplicate these systems on AWS and have them always on.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nBackup and Restore - In most traditional environments, data is backed up to tape and sent off-site regularly. If you use this method, it can take a long time to restore your system in the event of a disruption or disaster. Amazon S3 is an ideal destination for backup data that might be needed quickly to perform a restore. Transferring data to and from Amazon S3 is typically done through the network, and is therefore accessible from any location.

    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nCreate an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) after installing the software and copy the AMI across all Regions. Use this Region-specific AMI to run the recovery process in the respective Regions\n\nAn Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration. You can use different AMIs to launch instances when you need instances with different configurations.\n\nFor the current use case, you need to create an AMI such that the application stack is already set up. But AMIs are bound to the Region they are created in. So, you need to copy the AMI across Regions for disaster recovery readiness.\n\nCopying a source AMI results in an identical but distinct target AMI with its own unique identifier. In the case of an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, each of its backing snapshots is, by default, copied to an identical but distinct target snapshot. (The sole exceptions are when you choose to encrypt or re-encrypt the snapshot.) You can change or deregister the source AMI with no effect on the target AMI. The reverse is also true. There are no charges for copying an AMI. However, standard storage and data transfer rates apply. If you copy an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, you will incur charges for the storage of any additional Amazon EBS snapshots.\n\nAWS does not copy launch permissions, user-defined tags, or Amazon S3 bucket permissions from the source AMI to the new AMI. After the copy operation is complete, you can apply launch permissions, user-defined tags, and Amazon S3 bucket permissions to the new AMI.\n\nAMIs Cross-Region copying: \n via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/CopyingAMIs.html\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nStore the installation files in Amazon S3 for quicker retrieval - Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service from AWS. It will not help with speeding up the installation since Amazon S3 is a storage service.

This has the effect of reducing latency and reducing your bill for Route 53 service.\n\nHowever, if you specify a longer value for TTL, it takes longer for changes to the record (for example, a new IP address) to take effect because recursive resolvers use the values in their cache for longer periods before they ask Route 53 for the latest information. If you're changing settings for a domain or subdomain that's already in use, AWS recommends that you initially specify a shorter value, such as 300 seconds, and increase the value after you confirm that the new settings are correct.\n\nFor this use-case, the most likely issue is that the TTL is still in effect so you have to wait until it expires for the new request to perform another DNS query and get the value for the new Load Balancer.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nThe CNAME Record is misconfigured - A CNAME record can redirect DNS queries to any DNS record.

Alias records let you route traffic to selected AWS resources, such as Amazon CloudFront distributions and Amazon S3 buckets. They also let you route traffic from one record in a hosted zone to another record. Unlike a CNAME record, you can create an alias record at the top node of a DNS namespace, also known as the zone apex.

    "explanation": "Correct options:\n\nUse AWS Direct Connect connection as a primary connection\n\nAWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry-standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. AWS Direct Connect does not involve the Internet; instead, it uses dedicated, private network connections between your intranet and Amazon VPC.\n\nUse AWS Site-to-Site VPN as a backup connection\n\nAWS Site-to-Site VPN enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). You can securely extend your data center or branch office network to the cloud with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. A VPC VPN Connection utilizes IPSec to establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the Internet. VPN Connections can be configured in minutes and are a good solution if you have an immediate need, have low to modest bandwidth requirements, and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based connectivity.\n\nAWS Direct Connect as a primary connection guarantees great performance and security (as the connection is private).

    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nUse Secure Sockets Layer certificate (SSL certificate) with SNI\n\nYou can host multiple TLS secured applications, each with its own TLS certificate, behind a single load balancer. To use SNI, all you need to do is bind multiple certificates to the same secure listener on your load balancer. ALB will automatically choose the optimal TLS certificate for each client.\n\nALB’s smart certificate selection goes beyond SNI. In addition to containing a list of valid domain names, certificates also describe the type of key exchange and cryptography that the server supports, as well as the signature algorithm (SHA2, SHA1, MD5) used to sign the certificate.\n\nWith SNI support AWS makes it easy to use more than one certificate with the same ALB. The most common reason you might want to use multiple certificates is to handle different domains with the same load balancer.

These policies grant the specified principal permission to perform specific actions on that resource and define under what conditions this applies.\n\nTrust policy\n\nTrust policies define which principal entities (accounts, users, roles, and federated users) can assume the role. An IAM role is both an identity and a resource that supports resource-based policies. For this reason, you must attach both a trust policy and an identity-based policy to an IAM role. The IAM service supports only one type of resource-based policy called a role trust policy, which is attached to an IAM role.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nAWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCP) - If you enable all features of AWS organization, then you can apply service control policies (SCPs) to any or all of your accounts.

The SCP limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including each AWS account root user. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow.\n\nAccess control list (ACL) - Access control lists (ACLs) are service policies that allow you to control which principals in another account can access a resource. ACLs cannot be used to control access for a principal within the same account.

    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nUse AWS CloudTrail to analyze API calls\n\nAWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With AWS CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. AWS CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command-line tools, and other AWS services.\n\nIn general, to analyze any API calls made within an AWS account, AWS CloudTrail is used. You can record the actions that are taken by users, roles, or AWS services on Amazon S3 resources and maintain log records for auditing and compliance purposes. To do this, you can use server access logging, AWS CloudTrail logging, or a combination of both. AWS recommends that you use AWS CloudTrail for logging bucket and object-level actions for your Amazon S3 resources.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nImplement an IAM policy to forbid users to change Amazon S3 bucket settings - You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP), access control list (ACL), and session policies.\n\nImplementing an IAM policy to forbid users would be disruptive and wouldn't go unnoticed.\n\nUse Amazon S3 access logs to analyze user access using Athena - Amazon S3 server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. Server access logs are useful for many applications. For example, access log information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help you learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3 bill. AWS recommends that you use AWS CloudTrail for logging bucket and object-level actions for your Amazon S3 resources, as it provides more options to store, analyze and act on the log information.\n\nImplement a bucket policy requiring AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MFA) for all operations - Amazon S3 supports MFA-protected API access, a feature that can enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to your Amazon S3 resources. Multi-factor authentication provides an extra level of security that you can apply to your AWS environment. It is a security feature that requires users to prove the physical possession of an MFA device by providing a valid MFA code. Changing the bucket policy to require MFA would not go unnoticed.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/logging-with-S3.html\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-7",

A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents.

    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nUse multi-part upload feature of Amazon S3\n\nMulti-part upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object.\n\nAWS recommends that you use multi-part uploading in the following ways: 1. If you're uploading large objects over a stable high-bandwidth network, use multi-part uploading to maximize the use of your available bandwidth by uploading object parts in parallel for multi-threaded performance. 2. If you're uploading over a spotty network, use multi-part uploading to increase resiliency to network errors by avoiding upload restarts. When using multi-part uploading, you need to retry uploading only parts that are interrupted during the upload. You don't need to restart uploading your object from the beginning.\n\nIn general, when your object size reaches 100 megabytes, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation. If the file is greater than 5 gigabytes in size, you must use multi-part upload to upload that file to Amazon S3.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nUse Amazon S3 Versioning - Amazon S3 Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects. If you overwrite an object, it results in a new object version in the bucket. You can always restore the previous version.\n\nUse AWS Direct Connect to provide extra bandwidth - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.\n\nAWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. This dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in Amazon S3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2 instances running within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using private IP space, while maintaining network separation between the public and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be reconfigured at any time to meet your changing needs. This is a physical connection that takes at least a month to set up.\n\nUse AWS Snowball - AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer dozens of terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. It provides up to 80 terabytes of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 gigabytes network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases.\n\n(The original AWS Snowball devices were transitioned out of service and AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are now the primary devices used for data transfer. You may see the Snowball device on the exam, just remember that the original AWS Snowball device had 80 terabytes of storage space).\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html",

It's a fully managed, multi-Region, multi-master, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications.\n\nAmazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement – from milliseconds to microseconds – even at millions of requests per second. DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables, without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation, data population, or cluster management.\n\nDAX will be transparent and won't require an application refactoring, and will cache the \"hotkeys\". Therefore, this is the correct option.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nUse Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables - Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables builds upon DynamoDB’s global footprint to provide you with a fully managed, multi-region, and multi-master database that provides fast, local, read and write performance for massively scaled, global applications. Global Tables replicates your Amazon DynamoDB tables automatically across your choice of AWS regions. But Global Tables cannot address the hotkey issue.\n\nUse Amazon DynamoDB Streams - Amazon DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information about changes to items in a DynamoDB table. When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information about every modification to data items in the table. Whenever an application creates, updates, or deletes items in the table, DynamoDB Streams writes a stream record with the primary key attributes of the items that were modified. A stream record contains information about a data modification to a single item in a DynamoDB table. DynamoDB Streams cannot address the hotkey issue.\n\nUse Amazon ElastiCache - Amazon ElastiCache allows you to seamlessly set up, run, and scale popular open-Source compatible in-memory data stores in the cloud. Build data-intensive apps or boost the performance of your existing databases by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores. Amazon ElastiCache is a popular choice for real-time use cases like Caching, Session Stores, Gaming, Geospatial Services, Real-Time Analytics, and Queuing. ElastiCache could also be a solution, but it will require a lot of refactoring work on the AWS Lambda side.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax/\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html",

Each VPN connection has two VPN tunnels which you can use for high availability. A VPN tunnel is an encrypted link where data can pass from the customer network to or from AWS. The following diagram shows the high-level connectivity with virtual private gateways.\n\nWith AWS Transit Gateway, you can simplify the connectivity between multiple VPCs and also connect to any VPC attached to AWS Transit Gateway with a single VPN connection. AWS Transit Gateway also enables you to scale the IPsec VPN throughput with equal cost multi-path (ECMP) routing support over multiple VPN tunnels. A single VPN tunnel still has a maximum throughput of 1.25 Gbps. If you establish multiple VPN tunnels to an ECMP-enabled transit gateway, it can scale beyond the default maximum limit of 1.25 Gbps. You also must enable the dynamic routing option on your transit gateway to be able to take advantage of ECMP for scalability.\n\n via - https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/transit-gateway-ecmp-multiple-tunnels/\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nUse Transfer Acceleration for the VPN connection to maximize the throughput - Transfer Acceleration is an Amazon S3 bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration is designed to optimize transfer speeds from across the world into S3 buckets. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of the globally distributed edge locations in Amazon CloudFront.\n\nThis option has been added as a distractor as it is not relevant to AWS VPN connections.\n\nUse AWS Global Accelerator for the VPN connection to maximize the throughput - AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that improves the performance of your users’ traffic by up to 60% using the global network infrastructure of AWS. When the internet is congested, AWS Global Accelerator optimizes the path to your application to keep packet loss, jitter, and latency consistently low. With Global Accelerator, you are provided two global static public IPs that act as a fixed entry point to your application, improving availability. Global Accelerator automatically re-routes your traffic to your nearest healthy available endpoint to mitigate endpoint failure.\n\nAWS Global Accelerator can be used to optimize the network path, using the congestion-free AWS global network to route traffic to the endpoint that provides the best application performance . You can use an accelerated VPN connection to avoid network disruptions that might occur when traffic is routed over the public internet. AWS Global Accelerator will not maximize the VPN throughput, so it is not the best fit for the given use case.\n\nCreate a virtual private gateway with equal cost multipath routing and multiple channels - A virtual private gateway is the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side of your Site-to-Site VPN connection that can be attached to a single VPC. A virtual private gateway does not support equal cost multi-path (ECMP) routing, so this option is incorrect.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transfer-acceleration.html\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/transit-gateway-ecmp-multiple-tunnels/",

You can use placement groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload. Depending on the type of workload, you can create a placement group using one of the following placement strategies:\n\nCluster – packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone (AZ). This strategy enables workloads to achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC applications.\n\nPartition – spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.\n\nSpread – strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.\n\nThere is no charge for creating a placement group.\n\nUse a Cluster placement group\n\nA cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone (AZ). A cluster placement group can span peered VPCs in the same Region. Instances in the same cluster placement group enjoy a higher per-flow throughput limit of up to 10 Gbps for TCP/IP traffic and are placed in the same high-bisection bandwidth segment of the network.\n\nCluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. They are also recommended when the majority of the network traffic is between the instances in the group. To provide the lowest latency and the highest packet-per-second network performance for your placement group, choose an instance type that supports enhanced networking.\n\nImage of Cluster placement group: \n via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\n\nImage of Partition placement group: \n via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\n\nImage of Spread placement group: \n via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nUse Spot Instances - A Spot Instance is an unused Amazon EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused Amazon EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are a cost-effective choice if you can be flexible about when your applications run and if your applications can be interrupted. Since performance is the key criteria, this is not the right choice.\n\nOptimize the Amazon EC2 kernel using EC2 User Data - Optimizing the Amazon EC2 kernel won't help with network performance as it's bounded by the EC2 instance type mainly. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nUse a Spread placement group - A spread placement group is a group of instances that are each placed on distinct racks, with each rack having its own network and power source. The instances are placed across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures. A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in the same Region.

APIs act as the \"front door\" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.\n\nYou can enable Amazon API caching in Amazon API Gateway to cache your endpoint's responses. With caching, you can reduce the number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of requests to your API. When you enable caching for a stage, API Gateway caches responses from your endpoint for a specified time-to-live (TTL) period, in seconds. Amazon API Gateway then responds to the request by looking up the endpoint response from the cache instead of requesting your endpoint. The default TTL value for API caching is 300 seconds. The maximum TTL value is 3600 seconds. TTL=0 means caching is disabled. Using API Gateway Caching feature is the answer for the use case, as we can accept stale data for about 24 hours.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nAdd Amazon Aurora Read Replicas - Amazon Aurora features a distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system that auto-scales up to 64TB per database instance. It delivers high performance and availability with up to 15 low-latency read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across three Availability Zones (AZs).\n\nAmazon Aurora Read Replicas are independent endpoints in an Aurora DB cluster, best used for scaling read operations and increasing availability. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability Zones that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region. The DB cluster volume is made up of multiple copies of the data for the DB cluster. However, the data in the cluster volume is represented as a single, logical volume to the primary instance and to Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. Adding Aurora Read Replicas would greatly increase the cost, therefore this option is ruled out.\n\nSwitch to using an Application Load Balancer - An Application Load Balancer functions at the application layer, the seventh layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. After the load balancer receives a request, it evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to apply, and then selects a target from the target group for the rule action. You can configure listener rules to route requests to different target groups based on the content of the application traffic. Switching to a Load Balancer would not improve the current status as we need a caching mechanism.\n\nEnable AWS Lambda In Memory Caching - AWS Lambda has no native in-memory caching capability. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute capacity.

    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nLeverage AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) as a bridge between Amazon S3 and Amazon Kinesis Data Streams\n\nYou can achieve this by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). AWS DMS enables you to seamlessly migrate data from supported sources to relational databases, data warehouses, streaming platforms, and other data stores in AWS cloud.\n\nThe given requirement needs the functionality to be implemented in the least possible time. You can use AWS DMS for such data-processing requirements. AWS DMS lets you expand the existing application to stream data from Amazon S3 into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for real-time analytics without writing and maintaining new code. AWS DMS supports specifying Amazon S3 as the source and streaming services like Kinesis and Amazon Managed Streaming of Kafka (Amazon MSK) as the target. AWS DMS allows migration of full and change data capture (CDC) files to these services. AWS DMS performs this task out of box without any complex configuration or code development. You can also configure an AWS DMS replication instance to scale up or down depending on the workload.\n\nAWS DMS supports Amazon S3 as the source and Kinesis as the target, so data stored in an S3 bucket is streamed to Kinesis. Several consumers, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics, and the Kinesis Consumer Library (KCL), can consume the data concurrently to perform real-time analytics on the dataset. Each AWS service in this architecture can scale independently as needed.\n\nArchitecture of the proposed solution: \n via - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/streaming-data-from-amazon-s3-to-amazon-kinesis-data-streams-using-aws-dms/\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nConfigure Amazon EventBridge events for the bucket actions on Amazon S3. An AWS Lambda function can then be triggered from the Amazon EventBridge event that will send the necessary data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams - You will need to enable AWS Cloudtrail trail to use object-level actions as a trigger for Amazon EventBridge events. Also, using AWS Lambda functions would require significant custom development to write the data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, so this option is not the right fit.\n\nLeverage Amazon S3 event notification to trigger an AWS Lambda function for the file create event. The AWS Lambda function will then send the necessary data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams - Using AWS Lambda functions would require significant custom development to write the data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, so this option is not the right fit.\n\nAmazon S3 bucket actions can be directly configured to write data into Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

        "explanation": "The given requirement needs the functionality to be implemented in the least possible time. You can use AWS DMS for such data-processing requirements. AWS DMS lets you expand the existing application to stream data from Amazon S3 into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for real-time analytics without writing and maintaining new code. AWS DMS supports specifying Amazon S3 as the source and streaming services like Kinesis and Amazon Managed Streaming of Kafka (Amazon MSK) as the target. AWS DMS allows migration of full and change data capture (CDC) files to these services. AWS DMS performs this task out of box without any complex configuration or code development. You can also configure an AWS DMS replication instance to scale up or down depending on the workload."

Each AWS service in this architecture can scale independently as needed."

You can use WORM protection for scenarios where it is imperative that data is not changed or deleted after it has been written. Whether your business has a requirement to satisfy compliance regulations in the financial or healthcare sector, or you simply want to capture a golden copy of business records for later auditing and reconciliation, Amazon S3 Object Lock is the right tool for you. Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.\n\n via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html\n\n via - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/protecting-data-with-amazon-s3-object-lock/\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nUse Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock\n\nA vault is a container for storing archives on Glacier. When you create a vault, you specify a vault name and the AWS Region in which you want to create the vault. Since Vault Lock is only for Glacier and not for Amazon S3, so it cannot be used for the given use-case.\n\nUse Amazon S3 cross-region replication (S3 CRR) - Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. The object may be replicated to a single destination bucket or multiple destination buckets. Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled. By default, when Amazon S3 Replication is enabled and an object is deleted in the source bucket, Amazon S3 adds a delete marker in the source bucket only. This action protects data from malicious deletions. If you have delete marker replication enabled, these markers are copied to the destination buckets, and Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted in both source and destination buckets. However, someone with administrative access to Amazon S3 can disable cross-Region replication and then delete all versions from both source as well as the destination, so this option will not be able to safeguard your data compared to Amazon S3 Object Lock.\n\nActivate AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MFA) delete on the Amazon S3 bucket - When working with Amazon S3 Versioning in Amazon S3 buckets, you can optionally add another layer of security by configuring a bucket to enable MFA (multi-factor authentication) delete. When you do this, the bucket owner must include two forms of authentication in any request to delete a version or change the versioning state of the bucket. Only the root account can enable MFA delete. MFA delete cannot be used for the given use case because it just represents an additional security layer and can be disabled by anyone having access to the root account credentials.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/protecting-data-with-amazon-s3-object-lock/",
