    "explanation": "<p>Lambda Layers are a way to centrally manage code and libraries that are shared across multiple Lambda functions. By packaging the common Python scripts into a Lambda Layer, the data engineer can easily manage and distribute updates.</p><p>When the layer is updated, all functions referencing it automatically get access to the latest version. This significantly reduces the manual effort required to update each Lambda function individually whenever the shared scripts change.</p><p><strong>CORRECT: </strong>\"Package the shared Python scripts into a Lambda Layer and associate this layer with all the relevant Lambda functions\" is the correct answer (as explained above.)</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Utilize AWS CodeCommit to store the Python scripts and set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy updates to the Lambda functions\" is incorrect.</p><p>While using AWS CodeCommit and a CI/CD pipeline can automate the deployment of updates, it still requires the Python scripts to be included in each Lambda function's deployment package. This doesn't reduce the effort of managing shared code as effectively as Lambda Layers.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Create an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volume with the Python scripts and mount it across all the Lambda functions\" is incorrect.</p><p>Mounting an EFS volume with the shared scripts is a viable option for sharing code, but it adds complexity and is not as straightforward as using Lambda Layers. EFS is more suitable for sharing larger files or datasets that don't fit into a Lambda deployment package.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Implement an AWS Step Functions workflow to orchestrate the updates of the Python scripts across all Lambda functions simultaneously\" is incorrect.</p><p>AWS Step Functions is a service for coordinating multiple AWS services into serverless workflows. While it could orchestrate updates, it would be an overly complex solution for this scenario. Step Functions does not inherently simplify the process of updating shared code in Lambda functions like Lambda Layers do.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/chapter-layers.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/chapter-layers.html</a></p><p><strong>Save time with our AWS cheat sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://digitalcloud.training/aws-certified-data-engineer-associate-cheat-sheet/\">https://digitalcloud.training/aws-certified-data-engineer-associate-cheat-sheet/</a></p>",

    "explanation": "<p>Using the ALL distribution style for smaller tables, especially those frequently involved in joins, ensures that their data is replicated across all nodes in the Redshift cluster. This approach minimizes data shuffling during query execution, leading to faster query performance.</p><p>For larger tables, maintaining the current distribution style (like EVEN) and optimizing sort keys can help improve query efficiency without the need for additional hardware resources. This strategy is effective in balancing performance and cost, especially in a budget-constrained environment</p><p><strong>CORRECT: </strong>\"Implement the ALL distribution style for the smaller dimension tables that are frequently joined in queries and adjust sort keys for improved query performance\" is the correct answer (as explained above.)</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Continue using EVEN distribution for transaction tables and switch to KEY distribution for dimension tables to co-locate related data\" is incorrect.</p><p>While KEY distribution can be effective for specific scenarios, it doesn’t automatically ensure optimal performance across different table sizes and types. It can lead to data skew if the chosen key is not uniformly distributed.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Apply the EVEN distribution style to the transaction tables and use the ALL distribution style for the frequently joined dimension tables\" is incorrect.</p><p>This option is close to the correct one, but it doesn't mention the use of sort keys.
