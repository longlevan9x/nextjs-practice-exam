    "question": "<p>A Solutions Architect needs to deploy a mobile application that collects votes for a singing competition. Millions of users from around the world will submit votes using their mobile phones. These votes must be collected and stored in a highly scalable and highly available database which will be queried for real-time ranking.

    "explanation": "<p>Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data import and export tools. DynamoDB tables are schemaless—other than the primary key, you do not need to define any extra attributes or data types when you create a table, which is why it's suitable for data with frequently changing schema.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/Untitled1-1024x467.png\"></p><p><strong>DynamoDB</strong> is durable, scalable, and highly available data store which can be used for real-time tabulation. You can also use <strong>AppSync</strong> with DynamoDB to make it easy for you to build collaborative apps that keep shared data updated in real-time. You just specify the data for your app with simple code statements and AWS AppSync manages everything needed to keep the app data updated in real-time. This will allow your app to access data in Amazon DynamoDB, trigger AWS Lambda functions, or run Amazon OpenSearch Service queries and combine data from these services to provide the exact data you need for your app.</p><p><strong>Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) and Amazon AppFlow</strong> are incorrect. While Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is a viable database option, Amazon AppFlow cannot interface with it to query updates. Amazon AppFlow is simply an integration service for transferring data securely between Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, SAP, Zendesk, Slack, ServiceNow, and AWS services.</p><p><strong>Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Amazon MQ</strong> are incorrect. Updating schema changes in a relational database is a complicated process. Using a NoSQL database such as DynamoDB is more suitable for what the scenario is asking. Additionally, Amazon MQ is just a message broker for Apache MQ and RabbitMQ — it's not needed in the solution.</p><p><strong>Amazon Aurora and Amazon Cognito</strong> are incorrect. Like the other incorrect option, relational database solutions, such as Amazon Aurora and RDS, are impractical for data with a frequently changing schema. Additionally, Amazon Cognito is just a service for user authentication and authorization, neither of which is mentioned in the scenario.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/faqs/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/\">https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Amazon DynamoDB Overview:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/3ZOyUNIeorU?si=CtRxky0RPD_lB4mj\">https://youtu.be/3ZOyUNIeorU?si=CtRxky0RPD_lB4mj</a></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon DynamoDB Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-dynamodb/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-dynamodb/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorials Dojo's AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam Study Guide:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A solutions architect is writing an AWS Lambda function that will process encrypted documents from an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system. The documents are protected by an AWS KMS customer key. After processing the documents, the Lambda function will store the results in an S3 bucket with an Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class. The solutions architect must ensure that the files can be decrypted by the Lambda function.</p><p>Which action accomplishes the requirement?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>A key policy is a resource policy for an AWS KMS key. Key policies are the primary way to control access to KMS keys. Every KMS key must have exactly one key policy. The statements in the key policy determine who has permission to use the KMS key and how they can use it. You can also use IAM policies and grants to control access to the KMS key, but every KMS key must have a key policy.</p><p>Unless the key policy explicitly allows it, you cannot use IAM policies to allow access to a KMS key. Without permission from the key policy, IAM policies that allow permissions have no effect. (You can use an IAM policy to deny permission to a KMS key without permission from a key policy.) The default key policy enables IAM policies. To enable IAM policies in your key policy, add the policy statement described <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-default.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam\">here.</a></p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/kms-key-policy-sample.jpg\"></p><p>All Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems is encrypted at rest with keys managed using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Data is automatically encrypted before being written to the file system and automatically decrypted as it is read. These processes are handled transparently by Amazon FSx, so you don't have to modify your applications. Amazon FSx uses an industry-standard AES-256 encryption algorithm to encrypt Amazon FSx data and metadata at rest.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Attach the </strong><code><strong>kms:decrypt</strong></code><strong> permission to the Lambda function’s execution role. Add a statement to the AWS KMS key’s policy that grants the function’s execution role the </strong><code><strong>kms:decrypt</strong></code><strong> permission.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Attach the </strong><code><strong>kms:decrypt</strong></code><strong> permission to the Lambda function's resource policy. Add a statement to the AWS KMS key’s policy that grants the function’s resource policy ARN the </strong><code><strong>kms:decrypt</strong></code><strong> permission </strong>is incorrect. The resource policy specifies who can invoke the Lambda function, not which AWS operations it can use.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Attach the </strong><code><strong>kms:decrypt</strong></code><strong> permission to the Lambda function's execution role. Add a statement to the AWS KMS key’s policy that grants the function’s ARN the </strong><code><strong>kms:decrypt</strong></code><strong> permission</strong> is incorrect. You must use the ARN of the function's execution role as the principal instead of the actual ARN of the function. The reason for this is that AWS Lambda interacts with other AWS services using the permissions associated with an execution role.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Attach the </strong><code><strong>kms:decrypt</strong></code><strong> permission to the Lambda function's resource policy. Add a statement to the AWS KMS key’s policy that grants the function’s execution role the </strong><code><strong>kms:decrypt</strong></code><strong> permission </strong>is incorrect.

    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Your VPC has an implicit router and you use route tables to control where network traffic is directed. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table, which controls the routing for the subnet (subnet route table). You can explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table. Otherwise, the subnet is implicitly associated with the main route table.</p><p>A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time, but you can associate multiple subnets with the same subnet route table. You can optionally associate a route table with an internet gateway or a virtual private gateway (gateway route table).

    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",

It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you are already using today.</p><p>It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration.

    "question": "<p>A tech startup is launching an on-demand food delivery platform using Amazon ECS cluster with an AWS Fargate serverless compute engine and Amazon Aurora. It is expected that the database read queries will significantly increase in the coming weeks ahead. A Solutions Architect recently launched two Read Replicas to the database cluster to improve the platform's scalability. </p><p>Which of the following is the MOST suitable configuration that the Architect should implement to load balance all of the incoming read requests equally to the two Read Replicas?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> typically involves a cluster of DB instances instead of a single instance. Each connection is handled by a specific DB instance. When you connect to an Aurora cluster, the hostname and port that you specify point to an intermediate handler called an <em>endpoint</em>. Aurora uses the endpoint mechanism to abstract these connections. Thus, you don't have to hardcode all the hostnames or write your own logic for load-balancing and rerouting connections when some DB instances aren't available.</p><p>For certain Aurora tasks, different instances or groups of instances perform different roles. For example, the primary instance handles all data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas handle read-only query traffic.</p><p>Using endpoints, you can map each connection to the appropriate instance or group of instances based on your use case. For example, to perform DDL statements, you can connect to whichever instance is the primary instance. To perform queries, you can connect to the reader endpoint, with Aurora automatically performing load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas. For clusters with DB instances of different capacities or configurations, you can connect to custom endpoints associated with different subsets of DB instances. For diagnosis or tuning, you can connect to a specific instance endpoint to examine details about a specific DB instance.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/2020-01-21_05-42-25-d8c9d3cf71ef799dc5fffa57e7e2928d.png\"></p><p>A <em>reader endpoint</em> for an Aurora DB cluster provides load-balancing support for read-only connections to the DB cluster. Use the reader endpoint for read operations, such as queries. By processing those statements on the read-only Aurora Replicas, this endpoint reduces the overhead on the primary instance. It also helps the cluster to scale the capacity to handle simultaneous <code>SELECT</code> queries, proportional to the number of Aurora Replicas in the cluster. Each Aurora DB cluster has one reader endpoint.</p><p>If the cluster contains one or more Aurora Replicas, the reader endpoint load balances each connection request among the Aurora Replicas. In that case, you can only perform read-only statements such as <code>SELECT</code> in that session. If the cluster only contains a primary instance and no Aurora Replicas, the reader endpoint connects to the primary instance. In that case, you can perform write operations through the endpoint.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is to <strong>use the built-in Reader endpoint of the Amazon Aurora database.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use the built-in Cluster endpoint of the Amazon Aurora database</strong> is incorrect because a cluster endpoint (also known as a writer endpoint) simply connects to the current primary DB instance for that DB cluster. This endpoint can perform write operations in the database such as DDL statements, which is perfect for handling production traffic but not suitable for handling queries for reporting since there will be no write database operations that will be sent.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Enable Amazon Aurora Parallel Query </strong>is incorrect because this feature simply enables Amazon Aurora to push down and distribute the computational load of a single query across thousands of CPUs in Aurora's storage layer. Take note that it does not load balance all of the incoming read requests equally to the two Read Replicas. With Parallel Query, query processing is pushed down to the Aurora storage layer. The query gains a large amount of computing power, and it needs to transfer far less data over the network. In the meantime, the Aurora database instance can continue serving transactions with much less interruption. This way, you can run transactional and analytical workloads alongside each other in the same Aurora database, while maintaining high performance.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a new Network Load Balancer to evenly distribute the read queries to the Read Replicas of the Amazon Aurora database </strong>is incorrect because a Network Load Balancer is not the suitable service/component to use for this requirement since an NLB is primarily used to distribute traffic to servers, not Read Replicas. You have to use the built-in Reader endpoint of the Amazon Aurora database instead.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References</strong>:</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.Endpoints.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.Endpoints.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/parallel-query/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/parallel-query/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon Aurora Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-aurora/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-aurora/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A manufacturing company has EC2 instances running in AWS. The EC2 instances are configured with Auto Scaling. There are a lot of requests being lost because of too much load on the servers. The Auto Scaling is launching new EC2 instances to take the load accordingly yet, there are still some requests that are being lost. </p><p>Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution that you should implement to avoid losing recently submitted requests?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</strong> is a fully managed message queuing service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Building applications from individual components that each perform a discrete function improves scalability and reliability and is best practice design for modern applications. SQS makes it simple and cost-effective to decouple and coordinate the components of a cloud application. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume without losing messages or requiring other services to be always available.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/sqs-message-lifecycle-diagram.png\"></p><p>The number of messages in your Amazon SQS queue does not solely define the number of instances needed. In fact, the number of instances in the fleet can be driven by multiple factors, including how long it takes to process a message and the acceptable amount of latency (queue delay).</p><p>The solution is to use a <em>backlog per instance</em> metric with the target value being the <em>acceptable backlog per instance</em> to maintain. You can calculate these numbers as follows:</p><p><strong>Backlog per instance</strong>: To determine your backlog per instance, start with the Amazon SQS metric <code>ApproximateNumberOfMessages</code> to determine the length of the SQS queue (number of messages available for retrieval from the queue). Divide that number by the fleet's running capacity, which for an Auto Scaling group is the number of instances in the <code>InService</code> state, to get the backlog per instance.</p><p><strong>Acceptable backlog per instance</strong>: To determine your target value, first calculate what your application can accept in terms of latency. Then, take the acceptable latency value and divide it by the average time that an EC2 instance takes to process a message.</p><p>To illustrate with an example, let's say that the current <code>ApproximateNumberOfMessages</code> is 1500 and the fleet's running capacity is 10. If the average processing time is 0.1 seconds for each message and the longest acceptable latency is 10 seconds then the acceptable backlog per instance is 10 / 0.1, which equals 100. This means that 100 is the target value for your target tracking policy. Because the backlog per instance is currently at 150 (1500 / 10), your fleet scales out by five instances to maintain proportion to the target value.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Use an Amazon SQS queue to decouple the application components and scale-out the EC2 instances based upon the </strong><code><strong>ApproximateNumberOfMessages</strong></code><strong> metric in Amazon CloudWatch.</strong></p><p><strong>Replacing the Auto Scaling group with a cluster placement group to achieve a low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication </strong>is incorrect. Although it is true that a cluster placement group allows you to achieve a low-latency network performance, you still need to use Auto Scaling for your architecture to add more EC2 instances.</p><p><strong>Using larger instances for your application with an attached Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)</strong> is incorrect because using a larger EC2 instance would not prevent data from being lost in case of a larger spike. You can take advantage of the durability and elasticity of SQS to keep the messages available for consumption by your instances. Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is simply a network interface for Amazon EC2 instances that enables customers to run applications requiring high levels of inter-node communications at scale on AWS.</p><p><strong>Setting up Amazon Aurora Serverless for on-demand, auto-scaling configuration of your EC2 Instances and also enabling Amazon Aurora Parallel Query feature for faster analytical queries over your current data</strong> is incorrect. Although the Amazon Aurora Parallel Query feature provides faster analytical queries over your current data, Amazon Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for your database, and NOT for your EC2 instances. This is actually an auto-scaling configuration for your Amazon Aurora database and not for your compute services.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon SQS Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-sqs/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-sqs/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A company is using multiple AWS accounts that are consolidated using AWS Organizations. They want to copy several S3 objects to another S3 bucket that belonged to a different AWS account which they also own. The Solutions Architect was instructed to set up the necessary permissions for this task and to ensure that the destination account owns the copied objects and not the account it was sent from. </p><p>How can the Architect accomplish this requirement?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>By default, an S3 object is owned by the account that uploaded the object. That's why granting the destination account the permissions to perform the cross-account copy makes sure that the destination owns the copied objects. You can also change the ownership of an object by changing its access control list (ACL) to bucket-owner-full-control.</p><p>However, object ACLs can be difficult to manage for multiple objects, so it's a best practice to grant programmatic cross-account permissions to the destination account. Object ownership is important for managing permissions using a bucket policy. For a bucket policy to apply to an object in the bucket, the object must be owned by the account that owns the bucket. You can also manage object permissions using the object's ACL. However, object ACLs can be difficult to manage for multiple objects, so it's best practice to use the bucket policy as a centralized method for setting permissions.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/access-policy-example.PNG\"></p><p>To be sure that a destination account owns an S3 object copied from another account, grant the destination account the permissions to perform the cross-account copy. Follow these steps to configure cross-account permissions to copy objects from a source bucket in Account A to a destination bucket in Account B:</p><p>- Attach a bucket policy to the source bucket in Account A.</p><p>- Attach an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to a user or role in Account B.</p><p>- Use the IAM user or role in Account B to perform the cross-account copy.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Configure cross-account permissions in S3 by creating an IAM customer-managed policy that allows an IAM user or role to copy objects from the source bucket in one account to the destination bucket in the other account. Then attach the policy to the IAM user or role that you want to use to copy objects between accounts.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Enable the Requester Pays feature in the source S3 bucket. The fees would be waived through Consolidated Billing since both AWS accounts are part of AWS Organizations</strong> is incorrect because the Requester Pays feature is primarily used if you want the requester, instead of the bucket owner, to pay the cost of the data transfer request and download from the S3 bucket. This solution lacks the necessary IAM Permissions to satisfy the requirement. The most suitable solution here is to configure cross-account permissions in S3.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in S3 by creating a bucket policy that allows an IAM user or role to copy objects from the source bucket in one account to the destination bucket in the other account</strong> is incorrect because CORS simply defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain, and not on a different AWS account.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Connect the two S3 buckets from two different AWS accounts to Amazon WorkDocs. Set up cross-account access to integrate the two S3 buckets. Use the Amazon WorkDocs console to copy the objects from one account to the other with modified object ownership assigned to the destination account</strong> is incorrect because Amazon WorkDocs is commonly used to easily collaborate, share content, provide rich feedback, and <a href=\"https://htmleditor.tools/\">collaboratively edit</a> documents with other users. There is no direct way for you to integrate WorkDocs and an Amazon S3 bucket owned by a different AWS account. A better solution here is to use cross-account permissions in S3 to meet the requirement.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example2.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example2.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/copy-s3-objects-account/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/copy-s3-objects-account/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cross-account-access-s3/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cross-account-access-s3/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p>",

    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>When you launch a new EC2 instance, the EC2 service attempts to place the instance in such a way that all of your instances are spread out across underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures. You can use <em>placement groups</em> to influence the placement of a group of <em>interdependent</em> instances to meet the needs of your workload. Depending on the type of workload, you can create a placement group using one of the following placement strategies:</p><p><strong><em>Cluster</em></strong> – packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC applications.</p><p><strong><em>Partition</em></strong> – spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.</p><p><strong><em>Spread</em></strong> – strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.</p><p>Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. They are also recommended when the majority of the network traffic is between the instances in the group. To provide the lowest latency and the highest packet-per-second network performance for your placement group, choose an instance type that supports enhanced networking.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/placement-group-cluster.png\"></p><p>Partition placement groups can be used to deploy large distributed and replicated workloads, such as HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra, across distinct racks. When you launch instances into a partition placement group, Amazon EC2 tries to distribute the instances evenly across the number of partitions that you specify. You can also launch instances into a specific partition to have more control over where the instances are placed.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/placement-group-partition.png\"></p><p>Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other. Launching instances in a spread placement group reduces the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same racks. Spread placement groups provide access to distinct racks and are, therefore, suitable for mixing instance types or launching instances over time. A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. You can have a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/placement-group-spread.png\"></p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Set up a cluster placement group within a single Availability Zone in the same AWS Region.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Set up a spread placement group across multiple Availability Zones in multiple AWS Regions</strong> is incorrect. Although using a placement group is valid for this particular scenario, you can only set up a placement group in a single AWS Region only. A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up AWS Direct Connect connections across multiple Availability Zones for increased bandwidth throughput and more consistent network experience</strong> is incorrect because this is primarily used for hybrid architectures. It bypasses the public Internet and establishes a secure, dedicated connection from your on-premises data center into AWS and not used for having low latency within your AWS network.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use EC2 Dedicated Instances with elastic inference accelerator</strong> is incorrect because these are EC2 instances that run in a VPC on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer and are physically isolated at the host hardware level from instances that belong to other AWS accounts. It is not used for reducing latency. In addition, elastic inference accelerators only enable customers to attach low-cost GPU-powered acceleration to Amazon EC2, Amazon SageMaker AI instances and other resources.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/\">https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon EC2 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2/</a></p>",

Multipart uploading is a three-step process: you initiate the upload, you upload the object parts, and after you have uploaded all the parts, you complete the multipart upload.

However, by default, any additional EBS volumes that you attach at launch, or any EBS volumes that you attach to an existing instance persist even after the instance terminates. This behavior is controlled by the volume's <code>DeleteOnTermination</code> attribute, which you can modify.</p><p>To preserve the root volume when an instance terminates, change the <code>DeleteOnTermination</code> attribute for the root volume to False.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-ebs-deleteontermination.PNG\"></p><p>This EBS attribute can be changed through the AWS Console upon launching the instance or through CLI/API command.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: <strong>Set the value of </strong><code><strong>DeleteOnTermination</strong></code><strong> attribute of the EBS volumes to </strong><code><strong>False</strong></code>.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use AWS DataSync to replicate root volume data to Amazon S3</strong> is incorrect because AWS DataSync does not work with Amazon EBS volumes.

To meet this design requirement, an application is deployed on an Auto Scaling group of Spot EC2 instances which processes the data and stores the results to DynamoDB and Redshift. The solution should have a built-in enhanced fan-out feature.</p><p>Which fully-managed AWS service can you use to collect and process large streams of data records in real-time with the LEAST amount of administrative overhead?</p>",
    "multiple": true,

    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams</strong> is used to collect and process large streams of data records in real-time. You can use Kinesis Data Streams for rapid and continuous data intake and aggregation. The type of data used includes IT infrastructure log data, application logs, social media, market data feeds, and web clickstream data. Because the response time for the data intake and processing is in real-time, the processing is typically lightweight.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of Kinesis Data Streams. The producers continually push data to Kinesis Data Streams, and the consumers process the data in real-time.

Amazon S3 access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as uploading and retrieving objects.</p><p><strong>AWS Data Exchange </strong>is incorrect because this is just a data marketplace service.</p><p><strong>Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)</strong> is incorrect. Although you can process streaming data in real-time with Amazon MSK, this service still entails a lot of administrative overhead, unlike Amazon Kinesis.

    "explanation": "<p>Hibernation provides the convenience of pausing and resuming the instances, saves time by reducing the startup time taken by applications, and saves effort in setting up the environment or applications all over again. Instead of having to rebuild the memory footprint, hibernation allows applications to pick up exactly where they left off.<br><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-ec2-hibernation.jpg\">While the instance is in hibernation, you pay only for the EBS volumes and Elastic IP Addresses attached to it; there are no other hourly charges (just like any other stopped instance).</p><p>Therefore, the correct answer is: <strong>Migrate the application to an EC2 instance with hibernation enabled.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Migrate the application to a Linux-based EC2 instance</strong> is incorrect.

Moreover, it is a risky thing to do as the application might have dependencies tied to the previous operating system that won't work on a different OS.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Enable the hibernation mode on the EC2 instance</strong> is incorrect. It is not possible to enable or disable hibernation for an instance after it has been launched.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Disable the instance metadata service to reduce the things that need to be loaded at startup </strong>is incorrect.

Since only EBS-backed instances can be stopped and restarted, it is implied that the instance is EBS-backed. Remember that an instance store-backed instance can only be rebooted or terminated, and its data will be erased if the EC2 instance is either stopped or terminated.</p><p>If you stopped an EBS-backed EC2 instance, the volume is preserved, but the data in any attached instance store volume will be erased. Keep in mind that an EC2 instance has an underlying physical host computer. If the instance is stopped, AWS usually moves the instance to a new host computer. Your instance may stay on the same host computer if there are no problems with the host computer. In addition, its Elastic IP address is disassociated from the instance if it is an EC2-Classic instance. Otherwise, if it is an EC2-VPC instance, the Elastic IP address remains associated.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/instance-store.jpg\"></p><p>Take note that an EBS-backed EC2 instance can have attached Instance Store volumes. This is the reason why there is an option that mentions the Instance Store volume, which is placed to test your understanding of this specific storage type.

While Amazon Timestream is great for storing and analyzing time-series data, it doesn’t directly address the requirement of moving data from S3 to a lower-cost storage option based on the age of the data. The best solution for this specific use case would be to use Lifecycle Policies in S3 to move obsolete data to Glacier, which is a low-cost storage service in AWS. This can be done by setting up some rules (e.g., which folder) and it will transition the data.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html\">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/archive-s3-to-glacier/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/archive-s3-to-glacier/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorials Dojo's AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam Study Guide:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/</a></p>",

The startup founders want to mitigate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on their application. </p><p>Which of the following options are not suitable to be implemented in this scenario? (Select TWO.)</p>",

    "explanation": "<p>Take note that the question asks about the viable mitigation techniques that are <strong>NOT</strong> suitable to prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.</p><p>A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attack that can make your website or application unavailable to end users. To achieve this, attackers use a variety of techniques that consume network or other resources, disrupting access for legitimate end users.</p><p>To protect your system from DDoS attack, you can do the following:</p><p>- Use an Amazon CloudFront service for distributing both static and dynamic content.</p><p>- Use an Application Load Balancer with Auto Scaling groups for your EC2 instances. Prevent direct Internet traffic to your Amazon RDS database by deploying it to a new private subnet.</p><p>- Set up alerts in Amazon CloudWatch to look for high <code><strong>Network In</strong></code> and CPU utilization metrics.</p><p>Services that are available within AWS Regions, like Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), allow you to build Distributed Denial of Service resiliency and scale to handle unexpected volumes of traffic within a given region. Services that are available in AWS edge locations, like Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, Amazon Route53, and Amazon API Gateway, allow you to take advantage of a global network of edge locations that can provide your application with greater fault tolerance and increased scale for managing larger volumes of traffic.</p><p>In addition, you can also use <strong>AWS Shield</strong> and <strong>AWS WAF</strong> to fortify your cloud network. AWS Shield is a managed DDoS protection service that is available in two tiers: Standard and Advanced. AWS Shield Standard applies always-on detection and inline mitigation techniques, such as deterministic packet filtering and priority-based traffic shaping, to minimize application downtime and latency.</p><p><strong>AWS WAF</strong> is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. You can use AWS WAF to define customizable web security rules that control which traffic accesses your web applications. If you use AWS Shield Advanced, you can use AWS WAF at no extra cost for those protected resources and can engage the DRT to create WAF rules.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/lb-app-ddos-mitigation.5fd8c473963ad36250ce5b01e631aaa6f657aff4.png\"></p><p><strong>Using Dedicated EC2 instances to ensure that each instance has the maximum performance possible</strong> is not a viable mitigation technique because Dedicated EC2 instances are just an instance billing option. Although it may ensure that each instance gives the maximum performance, that by itself is not enough to mitigate a DDoS attack.</p><p><strong>Adding multiple Elastic Fabric Adapters (EFA) to each EC2 instance to increase the network bandwidth</strong> is also not a viable option as this is mainly done for performance improvement and not for DDoS attack mitigation. Moreover, you can attach only one EFA per EC2 instance. An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High-Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications.</p><p>The following options are valid mitigation techniques that can be used to prevent DDoS:</p><p><strong>- Use an Amazon CloudFront service for distributing both static and dynamic content.</strong></p><p><strong>- Use an Application Load Balancer with Auto Scaling groups for your EC2 instances.

The Solutions Architect needs to install and configure the architecture that is composed of Microsoft Active Directory (AD) domain controllers, Microsoft SQL Server 2012, multiple Amazon EC2 instances to host the Microsoft SharePoint Server and many other dependencies. The Architect needs to ensure that the required components are properly running before the stack creation proceeds.</p><p>Which of the following should the Architect do to meet this requirement?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>You can associate the <code><strong>CreationPolicy</strong></code> attribute with a resource to prevent its status from reaching create complete until AWS CloudFormation receives a specified number of success signals or the timeout period is exceeded. To signal a resource, you can use the cfn-signal helper script or SignalResource API. AWS CloudFormation publishes valid signals to the stack events so that you track the number of signals sent.</p><p>The creation policy is invoked only when AWS CloudFormation creates the associated resource. Currently, the only AWS CloudFormation resources that support creation policies are <code>AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup</code>, <code>AWS::EC2::Instance</code>, and <code>AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition</code>.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/CloudFormationEndpointDiagram-1024x483.png\"></p><p>Use the <code><strong>CreationPolicy</strong></code> attribute when you want to wait on resource configuration actions before stack creation proceeds. For example, if you install and configure software applications on an EC2 instance, you might want those applications to be running before proceeding. In such cases, you can add a <code>CreationPolicy</code> attribute to the instance and then send a success signal to the instance after the applications are installed and configured.</p><p>Hence, the option that says: <strong>Configure a </strong><code><strong>CreationPolicy</strong></code><strong> attribute to the instance in the CloudFormation template. Send a success signal after the applications are installed and configured using the </strong><code><strong>cfn-signal</strong></code><strong> helper script</strong> is correct.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Configure the </strong><code><strong>DependsOn</strong></code><strong> attribute in the CloudFormation template. Send a success signal after the applications are installed and configured using the </strong><code><strong>cfn-init</strong></code><strong> helper script</strong> is incorrect because the cfn-init helper script is not suitable to be used to signal another resource. You have to use cfn-signal instead. And although you can use the DependsOn attribute to ensure the creation of a specific resource follows another, it is still better to use the CreationPolicy attribute instead as it ensures that the applications are properly running before the stack creation proceeds.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Configure a </strong><code><strong>UpdatePolicy</strong></code><strong> attribute to the instance in the CloudFormation template. Send a success signal after the applications are installed and configured using the </strong><code><strong>cfn-signal</strong></code><strong> helper script </strong>is incorrect because the <code>UpdatePolicy</code> attribute is primarily used for updating resources and for stack update rollback operations.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Configure the </strong><code><strong>UpdateReplacePolicy</strong></code><strong> attribute in the CloudFormation template. Send a success signal after the applications are installed and configured using the </strong><code><strong>cfn-signal</strong></code><strong> helper script</strong> is incorrect because the <code>UpdateReplacePolicy</code> attribute is primarily used to retain or in some cases, back up the existing physical instance of a resource when it is replaced during a stack update operation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-creationpolicy.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-creationpolicy.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/deploying.applications.html#deployment-walkthrough-cfn-signal\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/deploying.applications.html#deployment-walkthrough-cfn-signal</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/use-a-creationpolicy-to-wait-for-on-instance-configurations/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/use-a-creationpolicy-to-wait-for-on-instance-configurations/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS CloudFormation Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cloudformation/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cloudformation/</a></p>",

DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables, without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation, data population, or cluster management.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/ddb_as_set_read_1.png\"></p><p><strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong> lets you create an API that acts as a \"front door\" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as code running on AWS Lambda. Amazon API Gateway handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization, and access control, monitoring, and API version management. Amazon API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs.</p><p><strong>AWS Lambda</strong> scales your functions automatically on your behalf. Every time an event notification is received for your function, AWS Lambda quickly locates free capacity within its compute fleet and runs your code. Since your code is stateless, AWS Lambda can start as many copies of your function as needed without lengthy deployment and configuration delays.</p><p>The correct answers are the options that say:</p><p><strong>- Enable DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and ensure that the Auto Scaling is enabled and increase the maximum provisioned read and write capacity.</strong></p><p><strong>- Use API Gateway in conjunction with Lambda and turn on the caching on frequently accessed data and enable DynamoDB global replication.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Configure CloudFront with DynamoDB as the origin; cache frequently accessed data on the client device using ElastiCache</strong> is incorrect. Although CloudFront delivers content faster to your users using edge locations, you still cannot integrate DynamoDB table with CloudFront as these two are incompatible.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use AWS IAM Identity Center to authenticate users and have them directly access DynamoDB using single sign-on. Manually set the provisioned read and write capacity to a higher RCU and WCU</strong> is incorrect because AWS IAM Identity Center is a service that just makes it easy to centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications. This will not be of much help to the scalability and performance of the application. It is costly to manually set the provisioned read and write capacity to a higher RCU and WCU because this capacity will run round the clock and will still be the same even if the incoming traffic is stable and there is no need to scale.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Since Auto Scaling is enabled by default, the provisioned read and write capacity will adjust automatically. Also enable DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) to improve the performance from milliseconds to microseconds</strong> is incorrect because by default, Auto Scaling is not enabled in a DynamoDB table, which is created using the AWS CLI.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/faqs/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/faqs/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax/\">https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorials Dojo's AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam Study Guide:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/</a></p>",

You are instructed by the CTO to configure the application to keep the transaction logs for one month for troubleshooting purposes, and then afterward, purge the logs.</p><p>What should you do to accomplish this requirement?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Cost-Optimized Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>In this scenario, the best way to accomplish the requirement is to simply configure the lifecycle configuration rules on the Amazon S3 bucket to purge the transaction logs after a month.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/lifecycle-transitions-v2.png\"></p><p>Lifecycle configuration enables you to specify the lifecycle management of objects in a bucket. The configuration is a set of one or more rules, where each rule defines an action for Amazon S3 to apply to a group of objects. These actions can be classified as follows:</p><p><strong>Transition actions</strong> – In which you define when objects transition to another storage class. For example, you may choose to transition objects to the STANDARD_IA (IA, for infrequent access) storage class 30 days after creation or archive objects to the GLACIER storage class one year after creation.</p><p><strong>Expiration actions</strong> – In which you specify when the objects expire. Then Amazon S3 deletes the expired objects on your behalf.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Configure the lifecycle configuration rules on the Amazon S3 bucket to purge the transaction logs after a month.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Add a new bucket policy on the Amazon S3 bucket</strong> is incorrect as it does not provide a solution to any of your needs in this scenario. You add a bucket policy to a bucket to grant other AWS accounts or IAM users access permissions for the bucket and the objects in it.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a new IAM policy for the Amazon S3 bucket that automatically deletes the logs after a month</strong> is incorrect because IAM policies are primarily used to specify what actions are allowed or denied on your S3 buckets. You cannot configure an IAM policy to automatically purge logs for you in any way.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Enable CORS on the Amazon S3 bucket which will enable the automatic monthly deletion of data</strong> is incorrect.

    "question": "<p>A Data Analyst in a financial company is tasked to provide insights on stock market trends to the company's clients. The company uses AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs in daily report generation, which involves fetching data from an Amazon S3 bucket. The analyst discovered that old data from previous runs were being reprocessed, causing the jobs to take longer to complete.</p><p>Which solution would resolve the issue in the most operationally efficient way?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>AWS Glue</strong> is a powerful tool that enables data engineers to build and manage ETL (extract, transform, load) pipelines for processing and analyzing large amounts of data. With AWS Glue, you can create and manage jobs that extract data from various sources, transform it into the desired format, and load it into a target data store.</p><p>One of the features that make AWS Glue especially useful is job bookmarking. Job bookmarking is a mechanism that allows AWS Glue to keep track of where a job is left off in case it gets interrupted or fails for any reason. This way, when the job is restarted, it can pick up from where it left off instead of starting from scratch.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/AWS-Glue_Event-Driven-ETL-06-07-2023.png\"></p><p>Job bookmarking works by storing the state of a job's progress in a persistent data store separate from the job itself. AWS Glue can resume a job from where it left off, even if the job, environment, or underlying data have changed. Job bookmarking is especially useful when dealing with large datasets or long-running jobs, as it helps save time and resources by avoiding unnecessary processing.</p><p>In this scenario, the company can benefit from enabling job bookmarking for the ETL job to improve the data extraction and analysis efficiency. Job bookmarking keeps track of the last processed data, allowing succeeding jobs to run only to process new data. This eliminates the need to reprocess old data and significantly reduces processing time and resource requirements.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Enable job bookmark for the ETL job.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Increase the size of the dataset used in the job to speed up the extraction and analysis process </strong>is incorrect. Increasing the dataset size will likely result in longer processing times and increased resource requirements. Therefore, it can aggravate the existing inefficiency problem rather than resolve it.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Parallelize the job by splitting the dataset into smaller partitions and processing them simultaneously using multiple EC2 instances </strong>is incorrect. This option requires additional AWS resources because of its complexity in partitioning the dataset, managing parallel processing, and coordinating the results. Moreover, this would only speed up the processing of both new and old data; it won't resolve the issue of reprocessing old data.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a Lambda function that removes any data already processed. Then, use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to trigger this function whenever the ETL job's status switches to </strong><code><strong>SUCCEEDED</strong></code> is incorrect. While removing processed data can help optimize storage, it introduces additional complexity and may not be fully efficient if the process of identifying which data has already been processed is not foolproof. Moreover, if a job fails and needs to be rerun, the data for that job might have been already removed, resulting in inconsistencies or incomplete data processing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/what-is-glue.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/what-is-glue.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-continuations.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-continuations.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out these AWS Glue Cheat Sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-glue/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-glue/</a></p>",

When you create a launch template, you specify information for the instances, such as the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, one or more security groups, and a block device mapping.

    "explanation": "<p><strong>AWS Fargate</strong> is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications. Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/Product-Page-Diagram_Fargate@2x.a20fb2b15c2aebeda3a44dbbb0b10b82fb89aa6a.png\"></p><p>Fargate allocates the right amount of compute, eliminating the need to choose instances and scale cluster capacity. You only pay for the resources required to run your containers, so there is no over-provisioning and paying for additional servers. Fargate runs each task or pod in its own kernel providing the tasks and pods their own isolated compute environment. This enables your application to have workload isolation and improved security by design. This is why customers such as Vanguard, Accenture, Foursquare, and Ancestry have chosen to run their mission-critical applications on Fargate.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Use AWS Fargate on Amazon EKS with Service Auto Scaling to run the containerized banking platform</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use Amazon ECS to run the Kubernetes cluster on AWS Fargate</strong> is incorrect because Amazon ECS is primarily used for running Docker containers instead of Kubernetes. A better solution is to use Amazon EKS instead.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Host the application in Amazon EMR Serverless and an EBS storage with the fast snapshot restore feature enabled</strong> is incorrect. Although the use of Amazon EMR Serverless will remove the manual overhead of maintaining virtual servers, this solution entails a lot of additional configuration required to run a Kubernetes cluster as opposed to using Amazon EKS + AWS Fargate. In addition, the use of the fast snapshot restore feature is not warranted and totally unnecessary since there's no requirement for data replication and high RTO/RPO.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Deploy an Amazon EKS Cluster on AWS Outposts with Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler and sync any orphaned pods with Amazon AppFlow</strong> is incorrect because launching an Amazon EKS cluster on AWS Outposts means that you have to maintain an AWS-provided physical rack server on your on-premises data center. This setup is not serverless and doesn't meet the given requirements. Moreover, the Amazon AppFlow service is meant for integrating 3rd party SaaS solutions to your AWS services and not orphaned Kubernetes pods.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_GetStarted_Fargate.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_GetStarted_Fargate.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon ECS Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-elastic-container-service-amazon-ecs/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-elastic-container-service-amazon-ecs/</a></p>",

    "explanation": "<p>In this scenario, it is best to use a combination of Amazon S3 and Amazon EMR: Amazon S3 for storing ELB log files and Amazon EMR for analyzing the log files. Access logging in the ELB is stored in Amazon S3 which means that the following are valid options:</p><p>- Amazon S3 for storing the ELB log files and an EC2 instance for analyzing the log files using a custom-built application.</p><p>- Amazon S3 for storing ELB log files and Amazon EMR for analyzing the log files.</p><p>However, log analysis can be automatically provided by Amazon EMR, which is more economical than building a custom-built log analysis application and hosting it in EC2. Hence, the option that says: <strong>Amazon S3 for storing ELB log files and Amazon EMR for analyzing the log files</strong> is the best answer between the two.</p><p>Access logging is an optional feature of Elastic Load Balancing that is disabled by default.

Although the use of the Amazon SageMaker BlazingText algorithm is technically valid, it still fails to meet the condition of not maintaining any ML-model. Using Amazon SageMaker would require you to train and deploy the model yourself. Added to that, the use of Amazon Fraud Detector is also unnecessary. Amazon Fraud Detector is commonly used to identify potentially fraudulent activities and not for running sentiment analysis. Do take note that Amazon Polly is not capable of transcribing audio recordings, and Amazon Rekognition is primarily used for image recognition service, not for translating foreign words into English.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Utilize the Amazon Lex service to convert audio recordings into text.

Amazon Lex is a fully managed artificial intelligence (AI) service with advanced natural language models that can help you design, build, test, and deploy conversational interfaces or chatbots. This service is not capable of transcribing any audio recordings into a text format. Amazon Textract only extracts text from documents and does not convert audio to text. Also, you cannot use the Amazon SageMaker Clarify service for running sentiment prediction and analysis.

This feature makes it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads.</p><p>You can create one or more replicas of a given source DB Instance and serve high-volume application read traffic from multiple copies of your data, thereby increasing aggregate read throughput. Read replicas can also be promoted when needed to become standalone DB instances.</p><p>For the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle database engines, Amazon RDS creates a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance. It then uses the engines' native asynchronous replication to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance. The read replica operates as a DB instance that allows only read-only connections; applications can connect to a read replica just as they would to any DB instance. Amazon RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/2020-02-28_01-52-40-4fa2635076a98c44c28464d31d793a21.png\"></p><p>When you create a read replica for Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, Amazon RDS sets up a secure communications channel using public-key encryption between the source DB instance and the read replica, even when replicating across regions.

By default, you can't do a write operation to your Read Replica.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Provides synchronous replication and automatic failover in the case of Availability Zone service failures</strong> is incorrect as this is a benefit of Multi-AZ and not of a Read Replica. Moreover, Read Replicas provide an asynchronous type of replication and not synchronous replication.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> It enhances the read performance of your primary database by increasing its IOPS and accelerates its query processing via AWS Global Accelerator</strong> is incorrect because Read Replicas do not do anything to upgrade or increase the read throughput on the primary DB instance per se, but it provides a way for your application to fetch data from replicas. In this way, it improves the overall performance of your entire database tier (and not just the primary DB instance). It doesn't increase the IOPS nor use AWS Global Accelerator to accelerate the compute capacity of your primary database. AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service not related to RDS that directs user traffic to the nearest application endpoint to the client, thus reducing internet latency and jitter.

There was a requirement to create a Lambda function that will process massive amounts of cryptocurrency transactions every minute and then store the results to EFS. After setting up the serverless architecture and connecting the Lambda function to the VPC, the Solutions Architect noticed an increase in invocation errors with EC2 error types such as <code>EC2ThrottledException</code> at certain times of the day.</p><p>Which of the following are the possible causes of this issue? (Select TWO.)</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Resilient Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</strong> is a service that enables you to create a virtual network. This virtual network is logically isolated from other networks, giving you full control over your virtual networking environment. It allows you to choose your own IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables and network gateways. With VPC, you can securely connect your AWS resources to your on-premises data center.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/2019-04-03_03-53-45-3550f2ecbfad29ea60f49fd5ea8d2809.gif\"></p><p><strong>Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)</strong> are virtual network interfaces that can be attached to instances or Lambda functions within your VPC. When you configure a Lambda function to access resources within a VPC, AWS Lambda creates and manages ENIs on your behalf. These ENIs are required for communication between the Lambda function and resources such as Amazon EFS within the VPC. Properly configuring your VPC and ensuring you have enough IP addresses and ENI capacity is crucial for your Lambda function to scale effectively without encountering errors like EC2ThrottledException.</p><p><strong>Service Quotas</strong> within Amazon VPC are important, especially when using AWS Lambda. As your Lambda function scales, it requires additional ENIs to maintain connectivity within the VPC. If your VPC reaches its quota limit for ENIs or IP addresses, your Lambda function may fail to scale, leading to invocation errors. Monitoring and adjusting these quotas and ensuring an optimal VPC configuration are essential to maintaining a stable and scalable serverless architecture.</p><p>Hence, the correct answers for this scenario are:</p><p><strong>- Your Lambda function exceeds the VPC quota for Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) or available IP addresses in the subnet.</strong></p><p><strong>- The Lambda function is placed in a VPC subnet with limited IP address capacity.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Your VPC does not have a NAT gateway</strong> is incorrect because an issue in the NAT Gateway is unlikely to cause a request throttling issue or produce an <code>EC2ThrottledException</code> error in Lambda. As per the scenario, the issue is happening only at certain times of the day, which means that the issue is only intermittent and the function works at other times. We can also conclude that an availability issue is not an issue since the application is already using a highly available NAT Gateway and not just a NAT instance.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>The associated security group of your function does not allow outbound connections</strong> is incorrect because if the associated security group does not allow outbound connections, then the Lambda function will not work at all in the first place. Remember that as per the scenario, the issue only happens intermittently. In addition, Internet traffic restrictions do not usually produce <code>EC2ThrottledException</code> errors.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>The attached IAM execution role of your function does not have the necessary permissions to access the resources of your VPC</strong> is incorrect because just as what is explained above, the issue is intermittent and thus, the IAM execution role of the function does have the necessary permissions to access the resources of the VPC since it works at those specific times. In case the issue is indeed caused by a permission problem, then an <code>EC2AccessDeniedException</code> the error would most likely be returned and not an <code>EC2ThrottledException</code> error.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/vpc.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/vpc.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/internet-access-lambda-function/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/internet-access-lambda-function/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Lambda Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-lambda/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-lambda/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A company that is rapidly growing in recent months has been in the process of setting up IAM users on its single AWS Account. A solutions architect has been tasked to handle the user management, which includes granting read-only access to users and denying permissions whenever an IAM user has no MFA setup. New users will be added frequently based on their respective departments.</p><p>Which of the following action is the MOST secure way to grant permissions to the new users?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong> in AWS is a simple best practice that adds an extra layer of protection on top of your user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS Management Console, they will be prompted for their user name and password (the first factor—what they know), as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device (the second factor—what they have). Taken together, these multiple factors provide increased security for your AWS account settings and resources. You can create an IAM Policy to restrict access to AWS services for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. The IAM Policy that enforces MFA authentication can then be attached to an IAM Group to quickly apply to all IAM Users.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/aws-iam-user-MFA-settings-saa-c03.png\"></p><p>An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. For example, you could have a user group called <em>Admins</em> and give that user group typical administrator permissions. Any user in that user group automatically has <em>Admins</em> group permissions. If a new user joins your organization and needs administrator privileges, you can assign the appropriate permissions by adding the user to the <em>Admins</em> user group. If a person changes jobs in your organization, instead of editing that user's permissions you can remove him or her from the old user groups and add him or her to the appropriate new user groups.</p><p>You can attach an identity-based policy to a user group so that all of the users in the user group receive the policy's permissions. You cannot identify a user group as a &lt;code\"&gt;Principal in a policy (such as a resource-based policy) because groups relate to permissions, not authentication, and principals are authenticated IAM entities.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is:<strong> Launch an IAM Group for each department. Create an IAM Policy that enforces MFA authentication with the least privilege permission. Attach the IAM Policy to each IAM Group.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Create an IAM Role that enforces MFA authentication with the least privilege permission. Set up a corresponding IAM Group for each department. Attach the IAM Role to the IAM Groups</strong> is incorrect because an IAM Group is usually provided with an IAM Policy and not an IAM Role. There is no direct way in the AWS Management Console to manually assign an IAM Role to a particular IAM Group.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a Service Role Policy (SCP) that enforces MFA authentication for each department. Add a trust relationship to every SCP and attach it to each IAM User</strong> is incorrect because an SCP can only be attached to the organization root, to an organizational unit (OU), or directly to an account, but not directly in the IAM User. Take note that the scenario explicitly mentioned that the company is using a single AWS account and not multiple AWS Accounts under a single AWS Organization.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Set up IAM roles for each IAM user and associate a permissions boundary that defines the maximum permissions </strong>is incorrect because you cannot directly associate an IAM role with an IAM user. The use of a permissions boundary is not warranted as well since this is primarily used to set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. The best practice is to grant the least privilege permission, and not the other way around.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/mfa/\">https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/mfa/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/mfa-iam-user-aws-cli/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/mfa-iam-user-aws-cli/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) cheat sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-identity-and-access-management-iam/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-identity-and-access-management-iam/</a></p>",

    "explanation": "<p>The best option to take is to deploy four EC2 instances in one Availability Zone and four in another availability zone in the same region behind an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer. In this way, if one availability zone goes down, there is still another available zone that can accommodate traffic.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/autoscaling-group-3-42.jpg\"></p><p>When the first AZ goes down, the second AZ will only have an initial 4 EC2 instances. This will eventually be scaled up to 8 instances since the solution is using Auto Scaling.</p><p>The 110% compute capacity for the 4 servers might cause some degradation of the service but not a total outage since there are still some instances that handle the requests. Depending on your scale-up configuration in your Auto Scaling group, the additional 4 EC2 instances can be launched in a matter of minutes.</p><p>T3 instances also have a Burstable Performance capability to burst or go beyond the current compute capacity of the instance to higher performance as required by your workload. So your 4 servers will be able to manage 110% compute capacity for a short period of time. This is the power of cloud computing versus our on-premises network architecture. It provides elasticity and unparalleled scalability.</p><p>Take note that Auto Scaling will launch additional EC2 instances to the remaining Availability Zone/s in the event of an Availability Zone outage in the region. Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: <strong>Deploy four EC2 instances with Auto Scaling in one Availability Zone and four in another availability zone in the same region behind an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Deploy eight EC2 instances with Auto Scaling in one Availability Zone behind an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer</strong> is incorrect because this architecture is not highly available.

    "question": "<p>A company has clients all across the globe that access product files stored in several Amazon S3 buckets, which are behind each of the respective Amazon CloudFront web distributions. The company currently wants to deliver content to a specific client, ensuring that only that client can access the data. At present, all clients can access the S3 buckets directly using an S3 URL or through the CloudFront distribution. The Solutions Architect must serve the private content via CloudFront only, to secure the distribution of files.</p><p>Which combination of actions should the Architect implement to meet the above requirements? (Select TWO.)</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Many companies that distribute content over the Internet want to restrict access to documents, business data, media streams, or content that is intended for selected users, for example, users who have paid a fee. To securely serve this private content by using CloudFront, you can do the following:</p><p>- Require that your users access your private content by using special CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies.</p><p>- Require that your users access your Amazon S3 content by using CloudFront URLs, not Amazon S3 URLs. Requiring CloudFront URLs isn't necessary, but it is recommended to prevent users from bypassing the restrictions that you specify in signed URLs or signed cookies. You can do this by setting up an origin access control (OAC) for your Amazon S3 bucket. You can also configure the custom headers for a private HTTP server or an Amazon S3 bucket configured as a website endpoint.</p><p>All objects and buckets by default, are private. The pre-signed URLs are useful if you want your user/customer to be able to upload a specific object to your bucket, but you don't require them to have AWS security credentials or permissions.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/Amazon_CloudFront_Origin_Access_Control_14March2024.png\"></p><p>You can generate a pre-signed URL programmatically using the AWS SDK for Java or the AWS SDK for .NET. If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio, you can also use AWS Explorer to generate a pre-signed object URL without writing any code. Anyone who receives a valid pre-signed URL can then programmatically upload an object.</p><p>Hence, the correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- Restrict access to files in the origin by creating an origin access control (OAC) and giving it permission to read the files in the bucket.</strong></p><p><strong>- Require the users to access the private content by using special CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a custom CloudFront function to check and ensure that only their clients can access the files </strong>is incorrect. CloudFront Functions are just lightweight functions in JavaScript for high-scale, latency-sensitive CDN customizations and not for enforcing security. A CloudFront Function runtime environment offers submillisecond startup times which allows your application to scale immediately to handle millions of requests per second. But again, this can't be used to restrict access to your files.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Enable the Origin Shield feature of the CloudFront distribution to protect the files from unauthorized access</strong> is incorrect because this feature is not primarily used for security but for improving your origin's load times, improving origin availability, and reducing your overall operating costs in CloudFront.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use S3 pre-signed URLs to ensure that only their client can access the files. Remove permission to use S3 URLs to read the files for anyone else</strong> is incorrect. Although this could be a valid solution, it doesn't satisfy the requirement to serve the private content via CloudFront only to secure the distribution of files. A better solution is to set up an origin access control (OAC) and then use Signed URL or Signed Cookies in your CloudFront web distribution.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon CloudFront cheat sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloudfront/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-cloudfront/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Comparison of AWS Services Cheat Sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/comparison-of-aws-services/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/comparison-of-aws-services/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A company is storing its financial reports and regulatory documents in an Amazon S3 bucket. To comply with the IT audit, they tasked their Solutions Architect to track all new objects added to the bucket as well as the removed ones. It should also track whether a versioned object is permanently deleted. The Architect must configure Amazon S3 to publish notifications for these events to a queue for post-processing and to an Amazon SNS topic that will notify the Operations team. </p><p>Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution that the Architect should implement?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>The <strong>Amazon S3 notification</strong> feature enables you to receive notifications when certain events happen in your bucket. To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration that identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications. You store this configuration in the <em>notification</em> subresource that is associated with a bucket. Amazon S3 provides an API for you to manage this subresource.</p><p><strong>Amazon S3 event notifications</strong> typically deliver events in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer. If two writes are made to a single non-versioned object at the same time, it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent. If you want to ensure that an event notification is sent for every successful write, you can enable versioning on your bucket. With versioning, every successful write will create a new version of your object and will also send an event notification.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/s3_notification_flow_2.png\"></p><p>Amazon S3 can publish notifications for the following events:</p><p>1. New object-created events</p><p>2. Object removal events</p><p>3. Restore object events</p><p>4. Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) object lost events</p><p>5. Replication events</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/2020-03-29_06-10-21-25e6fb0ac4acbec47824325e0c154564.png\"></p><p>Amazon S3 supports the following destinations where it can publish events:</p><p>1. Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic</p><p>2. Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue</p><p>3. AWS Lambda</p><p>If your notification ends up writing to the bucket that triggers the notification, this could cause an execution loop. For example, if the bucket triggers a Lambda function each time an object is uploaded and the function uploads an object to the bucket, then the function indirectly triggers itself. To avoid this, use two buckets, or configure the trigger to only apply to a prefix used for incoming objects.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is:<strong> Create a new Amazon SNS topic and Amazon SQS queue. Add an S3 event notification configuration on the bucket to publish </strong><code><strong>s3:ObjectCreated:*</strong></code><strong> and </strong><code><strong>s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete</strong></code><strong> event types to SQS and SNS.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a new Amazon SNS topic and Amazon MQ. Add an S3 event notification configuration on the bucket to publish </strong><code><strong>s3:ObjectAdded:*</strong></code><strong> and </strong><code><strong>s3:ObjectRemoved:*</strong></code><strong> event types to SQS and SNS</strong> is incorrect. There is no <code>s3:ObjectAdded:*</code> type in Amazon S3<strong>. </strong>You should add an S3 event notification configuration on the bucket to publish events of the <code>s3:ObjectCreated:*</code> type instead. Moreover, Amazon S3 does support Amazon MQ as a destination to publish events.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a new Amazon SNS topic and Amazon SQS queue. Add an S3 event notification configuration on the bucket to publish </strong><code><strong>s3:ObjectCreated:*</strong></code><strong> and </strong><code><strong>ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated</strong></code><strong> event types to SQS and SNS</strong> is incorrect because the <code>s3:ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated</code> type is only triggered<strong> </strong>when a delete marker is created for a versioned object and not when an object is deleted or a versioned object is permanently deleted.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a new Amazon SNS topic and Amazon MQ. Add an S3 event notification configuration on the bucket to publish </strong><code><strong>s3:ObjectCreated:*</strong></code><strong> and </strong><code><strong>ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated</strong></code><strong> event types to SQS and SNS</strong> is incorrect because Amazon S3 does public event messages to Amazon MQ. You should use an Amazon SQS instead. In addition, the <code>s3:ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated</code> type is only triggered<strong> </strong>when a delete marker is created for a versioned object. Remember that the scenario asked to publish events when an object is deleted or a versioned object is permanently deleted.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/s3-event-notification/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/s3-event-notification/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p>",

    "multiple": true,

    "explanation": "<p><strong>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS)</strong> is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources. You can use an AWS Lambda function to process records in Amazon KDS. By default, Lambda invokes your function as soon as records are available in the stream. Lambda can process up to 10 batches in each shard simultaneously. If you increase the number of concurrent batches per shard, Lambda still ensures in-order processing at the partition-key level.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/product-page-diagram_Amazon-Kinesis-Data-Streams.074de94302fd60948e1ad070e425eeda73d350e7.png\"></p><p>The first time you invoke your function, AWS Lambda creates an instance of the function and runs its handler method to process the event. When the function returns a response, it stays active and waits to process additional events. If you invoke the function again while the first event is being processed, Lambda initializes another instance, and the function processes the two events concurrently. As more events come in, Lambda routes them to available instances and creates new instances as needed. When the number of requests decreases, Lambda stops unused instances to free upscaling capacity for other functions.</p><p>Since the media company needs a real-time analytics service, you can use Kinesis Data Streams to gain insights from your data. The data collected is available in milliseconds. Use AWS Lambda to read records in batches and invoke your function to process records from the batch. If the batch that Lambda reads from the stream only has one record in it, Lambda sends only one record to the function.<br></p><p>Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is: <strong>Create a Kinesis Data Stream and use AWS Lambda to read records from the data stream</strong>.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a Data Firehose and use AWS Lambda to read records from the data stream</strong> is incorrect. Although Amazon Data Firehose captures and loads data in near real-time, AWS Lambda can't be set as its destination. You can write Lambda functions and integrate it with Data Firehose to request additional, customized processing of the data before it is sent downstream. However, this integration is primarily used for stream processing and not the actual consumption of the data stream. You have to use a Kinesis Data Stream in this scenario.</p><p>The options that say: <strong>Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the captured data and use Amazon Athena to analyze the data</strong> and <strong>Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the captured data and use Amazon Redshift Spectrum to analyze the data</strong> are both incorrect.

    "question": "<p>A company hosted a web application on a Linux Amazon EC2 instance in the public subnet that uses a non-default network ACL. The instance uses a default security group and has an attached Elastic IP address. The network ACL is configured to block all inbound and outbound traffic. The Solutions Architect must allow incoming traffic on port 443 to access the application from any source.</p><p>Which combination of steps will accomplish this requirement? (Select TWO.)</p>",
    "multiple": false,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>In order to connect to a service running on an instance, you need to make sure that both inbound traffic on the port that the service is listening on and outbound traffic from ephemeral ports are allowed in the associated network ACL. When a client connects to a server, a random port is generated (like 1024-65535) from the ephemeral port range with this becoming the client's source port.</p><p>The designated ephemeral port then becomes the destination port for return traffic from the service, so outbound traffic from the ephemeral port must be allowed in the network ACL. By default, network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic. If your network ACL is more restrictive, then you need to explicitly allow traffic from the ephemeral port range.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/Network_ACL_Ephemeral_Ports.png\"></p><p>The client that initiates the request chooses the ephemeral port range. The range varies depending on the client's operating system.</p><p>- Many Linux kernels (including the Amazon Linux kernel) use ports 32768-61000.</p><p>- Requests originating from Elastic Load Balancing use ports 1024-65535.</p><p>- Windows operating systems through Windows Server 2003 use ports 1025-5000.</p><p>- Windows Server 2008 and later versions use ports 49152-65535.</p><p>- A NAT gateway uses ports 1024-65535.</p><p>- AWS Lambda functions use ports 1024-65535.</p><p>For example, if a request comes into a web server in your VPC from a Windows 10 client on the Internet, your network ACL must have an outbound rule to enable traffic destined for ports 49152 - 65535. If an instance in your VPC is the client initiating a request, your network ACL must have an inbound rule to enable traffic destined for the ephemeral ports specific to the type of instance (Amazon Linux, Windows Server 2008, and so on).</p><p>In this scenario, you only need to allow the incoming traffic on port 443. Since security groups are stateful, you can apply any changes to an incoming rule and it will be automatically applied to the outgoing rule.</p><p>To enable the connection to a service running on an instance, the associated network ACL must allow both inbound traffic on the port that the service is listening on as well as outbound traffic from ephemeral ports. When a client connects to a server, a random port from the ephemeral port range (32768 - 65535) becomes the client's source port. Since the return traffic will use an ephemeral port, outbound traffic must be allowed on these ports to destination 0.0.0.0/0.</p><p>Hence, the correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- In the Security Group, add a new rule to allow TCP connection on port 443 from source </strong><code><strong>0.0.0.0/0</strong></code><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>- In the Network ACL, update the rule to allow inbound TCP connection on port 443 from source </strong><code><strong>0.0.0.0/0</strong></code><strong> and outbound TCP connection on port </strong><code><strong>32768 - 65535</strong></code><strong> to destination </strong><code><strong>0.0.0.0/0</strong></code><strong>.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> In the Security Group, create a new rule to allow TCP connection on port 443 to destination </strong><code><strong>0.0.0.0/0</strong></code><strong> </strong>is incorrect because this step just allows outbound connections from the EC2 instance out to the public Internet, which is unnecessary. Remember that a default security group already includes an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> In the Network ACL, update the rule to allow both inbound and outbound TCP connection on port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0 and to destination </strong><code><strong>0.0.0.0/0</strong></code> is incorrect because your network ACL must have an outbound rule to allow ephemeral ports (<code>32768 - 65535</code>). These are the specific ports that will be used as the client's source port for the traffic response.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> In the Network ACL, update the rule to allow outbound TCP connection on port </strong><code><strong>32768 - 65535</strong></code><strong> to destination </strong><code><strong>0.0.0.0/0</strong></code><strong> </strong>is incorrect because this step is just partially right.

The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/docdb-migration.html#docdb-migration-approaches\">Amazon DocumentDB Migration Guide</a> outlines three primary approaches for migrating from MongoDB to Amazon DocumentDB: offline, online, and hybrid.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/mongoDB-to-amazon-documentDB.jpg\"></p><p>The image above illustrates an offline migration approach, which is the fastest and simplest of the three but incurs the longest period of downtime. This approach is a good choice for proofs of concepts, development and test workloads, and production workloads for which downtime is not of primary concern. For online approach, you may use AWS DMS to minimize downtime. AWS DMS continually reads from the source MongoDB oplog and applies those changes in near-real time on the source Amazon DocumentDB cluster.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Migrate the cluster to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster and the database to an Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) database.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Migrate the cluster to an Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster using Amazon ECS Anywhere and the database to an Amazon Aurora Serverless database </strong>is incorrect. You can't directly migrate to Amazon Aurora because MongoDB is a non-relational database. Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Anywhere is simply a feature of Amazon ECS that enables you to easily run and manage container workloads on customer-managed infrastructure.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Migrate the cluster to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster using Amazon EKS Anywhere and the database to an Amazon DynamoDB table</strong> is incorrect. Although DynamoDB supports JSON-like documents, migrating from MongoDB to a DynamoDB table would involve code changes since the operations for accessing DynamoDB tables are different. DynamoDB has a different set of APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items than MongoDB. The use of Amazon EKS Anywhere is not warranted as well. This is only a new deployment option for Amazon EKS that allows customers to create and operate Kubernetes clusters on customer-managed infrastructure.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Migrate the cluster to an Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster with the images stored in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR).

    "question": "<p>A company requires that all AWS resources be tagged with a standard naming convention for better access control.

    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>You can assign metadata to your AWS resources in the form of tags. Each tag is a label consisting of a user-defined key and value. Tags can help you manage, identify, organize, search for, and filter resources. You can create tags to categorize resources by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.</p><p>You can use tags to control access by restricting IAM permissions based on specific tags or tag values. For example, IAM user or role permissions can include conditions to limit EC2 API calls to specific environments (such as development, test, or production) based on their tags.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/aws-managed-rules-tutorialsdojo-soa-c02.png\"></p><p>Since tags are case-sensitive, giving them a consistent naming format is a good practice. Depending on how your tagging rules are set up, having a disorganized naming convention may lead to permission issues like the one described in the scenario. In the scenario, the administrator can leverage the <code><strong>require-tags</strong></code> managed rule in AWS Config. This rule checks if a resource contains the tags that you specify.</p><p>Therefore, the correct answer is: <strong>Use an AWS Config rule to detect non-compliant tags.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use tag policies in AWS Organizations to standardize the naming of tags. Store all the tags in an Amazon S3 bucket with the S3 Object Lock feature enabled</strong> is incorrect. Although tag policies can help you enforce the standardization of tags, they won't be able to report resources that have non-compliant tags. The use of the S3 Object Lock feature in this scenario is not warranted. The S3 Object Lock is primarily used to store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model which can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a Lambda function that runs compliance checks on tagged resources. Schedule the function using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) </strong>is incorrect. While this is possible, using a manage AWS Config rule is a much simpler solution than writing a code running compliance checks.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use service control policies (SCP) to detect resources that are not tagged properly </strong>is incorrect. SCPs are just guardrails for setting up the maximum allowable permissions an IAM identity can have.

    "question": "<p>A company intends to give each of its developers a personal AWS account through AWS Organizations. To enforce regulatory policies, preconfigured AWS Config rules will be set in the new accounts. A solutions architect must see to it that developers are unable to remove or modify any rules in AWS Config.</p><p>Which solution meets the objective with the least operational overhead?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design Secure Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>Service control policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization. SCPs help you to ensure your accounts stay within your organization’s access control guidelines.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/aws-organizations-scp-demo.jpg\"></p><p>SCPs alone is not sufficient to grant permissions to the accounts in your organization. No permissions are granted by an SCP. An SCP defines a guardrail or sets limits on the actions that the account's administrator can delegate to the IAM users and roles in the affected accounts.</p><p>In the scenario, even if a developer has admin privileges, he/she will be unable to modify Config rules if an SCP does not permit it. You can also use SCP to block root user access. This prevents the developers from circumventing the restrictions on AWS Config access.</p><p>Therefore, the correct answer is: <strong>Add the developers' AWS account to an organization unit (OU). Attach a service control policy (SCP) to the OU that restricts access to AWS Config.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use an IAM Role in the new accounts with an attached IAM trust relationship to disable the access of the root user to AWS Config</strong> is incorrect. Keep in mind that the effects of IAM Policies do not apply to account root users. The \"trust relationship\" policy simply defines which principals can assume the IAM Role and under which conditions. Thus, this type of policy won't meet the requirement in the scenario.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Configure an AWS Config rule in the root account to detect if changes to the new account’s Config rules are made</strong> is incorrect. This solution just monitors changes on AWS Config rules; it does not restrict permissions, which is what's needed in the scenario.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up an AWS Control Tower in the root account to detect if there were any changes to the new account’s AWS Config rules. Attach an IAM trust relationship to the IAM User of each developer which prevents any changes in AWS Config </strong>is incorrect. The AWS Control Tower service is commonly used to set up and govern a secure multi-account AWS environment. This service is not used to restrict access from invoking an action to a specific resource, such as AWS Config, in your AWS account. The proper way of completing this requirement is to use a service Control Policy (SCP) and not a mere IAM Role with a trust relationship policy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/organizations.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/organizations.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Organizations cheat sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-organizations/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-organizations/</a></p>",

    "question": "<p>A solutions architect is designing an infrastructure for a serverless application. The application is packaged as a Docker image stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) and must be deployed on a fully managed serverless compute service. Additionally, the application requires 5 GB of ephemeral storage for temporary data processing.</p><p>Which deployment option meets these requirements?</p>",
    "multiple": true,
    "domain": "Design High-Performing Architectures",
    "explanation": "<p>AWS Lambda with Container Image Support is a fully managed, serverless compute service that allows you to run your applications without provisioning or managing servers. Traditionally, AWS Lambda functions were deployed using code written in supported programming languages, but with container image support, you can now package and deploy your application as a Docker container. This provides more flexibility, as it allows you to use custom runtimes or include dependencies that are difficult to manage in a traditional Lambda function deployment. Lambda functions with container images can be up to 10 GB in size, enabling you to deploy large, complex applications with ease.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/public/TD-AWS-Lambda-Ephemeral-Storage-03-17-2025.png\"></p><p>One of the key features of AWS Lambda is the ability to allocate ephemeral storage for each function instance. By default, Lambda functions come with 512 MB of temporary storage, but you can configure up to 10 GB of storage. This ephemeral storage is used for temporary data processing and is wiped clean after the execution of the function. This makes it a great choice for applications that need to perform tasks like data processing, file manipulation, or caching during their execution, without needing persistent storage.</p><p>Lambda with container image support provides a fully managed environment that automatically scales based on the workload. You are only billed for the compute time your code actually uses, and there are no charges for idle time, making it a cost-effective solution for many workloads. It abstracts away infrastructure management, ensuring that developers can focus on building applications without worrying about scaling, patching, or maintaining servers.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Deploy the application in an AWS Lambda function with Container image support. Set the function’s storage to 5 GB.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Deploy the application to an Amazon ECS cluster that uses AWS Fargate tasks</strong> is incorrect because Amazon ECS with Fargate tasks is not a fully serverless solution. While Fargate allows you to run containers without managing the underlying EC2 instances, it still requires you to configure and manage ECS services, task definitions, and clusters. ECS with Fargate is primarily used for containerized applications that require more granular control over the environment, including network configurations and scaling.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Deploy the application in an AWS Lambda function with Container image support. Attach an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume to the function </strong>is incorrect because it uses Amazon EFS for persistent storage, which is typically used for shared file systems that need to persist data across function invocations. However, the question specifies a need for ephemeral storage, which is temporary and does not require persistence. Attaching an EFS volume introduces additional complexity and is unnecessary when the application only needs temporary, in-memory storage during execution.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Deploy the application Amazon ECS cluster with Amazon EC2 worker nodes and attach a 5 GB Amazon EBS volume </strong>is incorrect because the scenario explicitly mentioned that the architecture must be serverless. Using Amazon EC2 instances for your worker nodes is not a serverless architecture.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/deploy-lambda-functions-with-container-images.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/deploy-lambda-functions-with-container-images.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out these AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda Cheat Sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-fargate/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-fargate/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-lambda/https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-lambda/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-lambda/https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-lambda/</a></p>",
