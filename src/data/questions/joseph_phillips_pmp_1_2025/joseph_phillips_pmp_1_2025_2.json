Scrum uses timeboxing for all the scrum events and as a tool for concretely defining open-ended or ambiguous tasks. Rather than allowing work to continue until the goal is reached and evaluating the time taken, the timebox approach consists of stopping work when the time limit is reached and evaluating what was accomplished. Timeboxing is the predetermined amount of time for the different portions of a sprint. Timeboxing is a predetermined and set amount of time, not a flexible amount of time. The scope, which is the product backlog, is flexible, but this is not the point of timeboxing.",

Then, you find the difference in the monthly fees, which is $1,938. Divide the $33,000 by $1,938, and this tells you how long the vendor's solution will be valid. If the software is to be kept longer than 17 months, it would be more cost-effective to build the software than to buy it. After 17 months, the build-it-yourself solution is a better choice.

Asking the team to work longer hours will make them counterproductive in the long term, and this action will not align with the agile principle of maintaining a sustainable pace. The scrum master could assist the development team with outstanding work, leaving a gap with his role. Scrum's roles, events, artifacts, and rules are immutable and although implementing only parts of scrum is possible, the result is not scrum. Extending the sprint timebox would lead to a loss of accountability and opportunity for improvement. If the sprint length is consistently modified, the scrum team loses the ability to write stories effectively, manage the backlog, estimate effort, and lose personal accountability. The timebox exists for accountability and to help each role learn and develop.",

A product owner must be in a position to accept an increment and to determine whether it is releasable. The project owner should represent all stakeholders’ interests and ensure that these interests are reflected in the understanding of the Definition of Done. Having a separate dedicated QA team would make the team less cross-functional and create waste. Large development teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to be advantageous.

Gold plating could increase the cost and risk as well as delay the schedule. It also increases the client's expectations. The next time a similar situation arises, the client will likely expect higher deliverables than what you originally agreed in the scope statement. If you do not deliver based on the client's higher expectations, the client will be left dissatisfied. A value-add change is a legitimate change that follows the project's change control system, which is not what has occurred in the mentioned scenario.

Contingency reserves are included in the cost baseline to address specific identified risks (known risks) whereas, management reserves are included in the project budget to address unknown risks. Using contingency reserves for unknown risks adversely affects the project's cost baseline. Therefore, of the choices provided, using contingency reserves instead of management reserves is what the project manager did wrong. The primary problem is where the funds originated from to address the unknown risk. Not all risks can be identified in project planning which is why there are unknown risk events in projects, so this choice is incorrect. The change request and baseline adjustment are not the best answer; the problem is the funding source for the risk response.",

    "explanation": "Chris should first confer with the product owner to determine how many product requirements have been identified and prioritized. The development team could get to work if the most important items have been prioritized in the product backlog. The entire product backlog does not need to be built and completely prioritized to start development. Chris cannot simply agree and start work with the development team as the product backlog must be adequately groomed for the team to select user stories. Referring the stakeholder to the steering committee is not the best choice for this scenario. Chris should speak with the product owner first, not necessarily stakeholders, even senior stakeholders.",
