Now all other stories are put in buckets according to size measured against the smaller story items. Dot voting lets the stakeholders and team vote on requirements using dot stickers and is not a good approach for many requirements and sizing. Planning poker is an agile estimating technique using poker cards to vote on the size of user stories. It is a good approach for smaller teams but is not very fast.

Shana found this problem from a periodic evaluation, and it is considered a failure found by the project. Appraisal costs are costs that measure the quality of the product being developed and include testing and inspections. Prevention costs are the cost to build a quality product and include training. External failure costs are found by the customer and include warranty work and lost business.",

A previous project manager has left the organization, and now you have been assigned this project. One of the first issues presented that you must take on is a substantial repair cost.

As a new project manager of this project, you need to get a good grasp on the issue. You will need to determine what it will take to repair the problem and the likely cost of the repair. Contacting the previous project manager is not the best choice presented. The last project manager may, or may not, be of much help. It would not be the best choice to approve additional costs immediately without assessing and analyzing the situation and impact. Performing integrated change control is tempting, but you first need to understand the issue, its cost, and the work required to fix the problem.",

    "question": "Ethan is the project manager of the NHA Project for his company, and he is working with two stakeholders who have conflicting objectives. One of the stakeholders, Nancy, is demanding a different grade of tile for the floors, while the opposing stakeholder, Mike, insists the new tile will cost too much for the project, and he does not really like the tile anyway. You get the two stakeholders to agree that if Nancy pays for the difference in tile costs from her budget, Mike will agree to the change in tile. What type of conflict resolution is this?",

Nancy gets the tile, but she will have to pay for the solution. Withdrawal means that one party withdraws from the disagreement, often as an angry or dissatisfied stakeholder. Smoothing is a yield-lose resolution because it yields to emotions rather than what may be best for the project.
