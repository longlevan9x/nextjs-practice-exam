Specifically, they are trying to estimate the cost and budget for constructing a suspension bridge across a narrow channel. Most of the engineers have experience working on suspension bridges, so they use their combined knowledge to estimate conservative and idealistic budgets, which they subsequently submit to their project manager. Which aspect of expert judgment is being used to determine the budget?",

In other words, the workers are still learning the process of installing the fixture, but with practice, it will take them less time to install the fixture than it does right now. Using a parametric estimate in this scenario is true, but the estimate is flawed as the learning curve was not considered. There is initial proof of how long each fixture takes to install. You would need to take another duration measurement later in the project to see how long the work takes as efficiency increased. Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time allotted to it. So, if you give an hour to complete a task, the worker will take an hour to complete the task because that is how much time they have available to do it. ",

    "explanation": "All of these choices would be concerning, but the best choice is a failure to communicate. Communication is an essential part of managing a project. A good project manager must always look to close the communication gap around business benefits, tailor communications to different stakeholder groups and understand the various types of communication. It is also essential to understand how these channels can be effective and perform effective use of standardized project communications practices. Good communication is not just a cornerstone of good project management; it also brings about other benefits in your continued relationships with your project team and your sponsor. Proper funding is an essential constraint to watch; however poor communication is a notorious project killer and one of the primary factors in project failure. Poor listening skill isn't the best choice as there is a breakdown in effective communication, not just listening. Staffing isn't the issue here, but communication skills is where the resolution should focus.",

Requesting to revert your plan to a command-and-control style of project management is not a good solution to the project and may cause resentment among the team. Crashing the schedule to complete the objectives on time is a possibility as adding more labor can distribute the workload for the team. However, the best option presented is to first meet with the team to discuss what they think is a more realistic timeline for the presented project work.

This investigation will let you deal with the vendor delay by ensuring that all possible activities can happen rather than waiting entirely for the vendor to deliver the needed items. The stakeholder management plan is not the best choice as this affects the schedule first. You will need to ascertain the effect the problem has on the schedule, then you will communicate that problem to the stakeholder if needed. While the procurement knowledge area is where the problem is stemming from, the process of procurement is not the issue at hand, so this choice is incorrect. Canceling the contract with the vendor is not the best first choice. You will need to understand the issue, the magnitude of the effect, and then take action from there.",

    "explanation": "Tate should use bottom-up estimating in this case. Bottom-up estimating involves estimating the costs of individual work packages or activities to the most significant level of specified detail. The detailed cost is then summarized or \"rolled up\" to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost and accuracy of bottom-up cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individual activity or work package. Analogous estimating involves using values, or attributes, of a previous project similar to the current project. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical knowledge and another variable. Three-point estimating takes the average of the most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic costs.",

While Sally is the project manager and has some authority, she should still listen to her team's feedback. Diving straight into a solution without understanding the problem runs the risk of missing out on key challenges.

Appraisers should be cautious and skeptical about their ability to gauge a person's abilities with whom they have a conflict. The recency error occurs when an appraiser over-exaggerates a good or bad event simply because it occurred recently. Although this is like a personal bias, in this case, the length of time between the incident and the appraisal is likely to mitigate the recency effect. Central tendency error is the habit of assigning a middling rating to all employees for all skills, which is unlikely and unhelpful. The strictness or leniency error is the tendency for an appraiser to grade in an excessively strict or lenient manner.",

    "question": "Sarah is a project manager for a predictive project, which is one month behind schedule and $20,000 over budget. The project is due for completion in two months, but it will be at least three months behind with the delay. This will cost the organization $150,000 in lost sales due to missing a market window. At a recent stakeholder meeting, multiple opinions on the best path forward were discussed, but no consensus was reached on which direction to take. What should Sarah do next?",

    "explanation": "Working with all stakeholders to reach a consensus, even if there is still some disagreement, is ideal as each will feel heard and represented in the decision. Waiting for the stakeholders to reach a consensus is not a good idea as it will take time and may not result in a positive outcome. Sarah should not escalate the issue to the project team, as they are the people completing the work, not making the decision on the project progression. Focusing on one or two senior stakeholders' ideas may not result in picking the best solution for the project.",

    "explanation": "The best answer is to escalate. This is a positive risk event beyond the Monogram Project's boundaries because it may generate additional revenue for the company, not the project. Enhancing would try to increase the probability of the risk event and is therefore incorrect. Share is incorrect because it occurs when the team agrees or there is a joint venture to seize the opportunity. Exploiting is making sure the opportunity occurs and is therefore incorrect.",
