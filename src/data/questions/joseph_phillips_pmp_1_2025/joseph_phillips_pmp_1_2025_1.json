A cost-reimbursable contract assigns risk to the buyer for cost overruns and is rarely used.

Escalation occurs when the scope is beyond the project's original parameters, or the required response would exceed the project manager's authority. Avoidance occurs when a team works to eliminate a threat or otherwise protect a project from risk. Transfer entails moving risk to another party, often a neutral third party like an insurer, to negate or minimize the impact of a realized risk. ",

Status reports should use a version number, often written as a date, to help identify and communicate project status. It is possible that the stakeholders do not have the current status report or that Wanda has not issued them updates. Information radiators may not be the best option in this case as there is no evidence an information radiator exists or that Wanda is utilizing an agile project. Assigning a project team member to assist the stakeholders is not ideal as Wanda does not know exactly which report the stakeholders have. The first thing to do is to confirm the most recent status reports the stakeholders have received, then rectify the problem. The steering committee is not used for providing updates, so this choice is incorrect.",

Still, it is typically not the source of a conflict when the behavior is meant to help. Team environment conflicts deal with the physical and political environment of the project. This is often evident during the storming phase of team development. Project priorities are a source of conflict when two or more project managers have a demand for the same resource, such as a team member or facility. This can also be when there are competing demands from different projects in a matrix structure.

Resource leveling levels the number of hours an employee can work on the project during a time period, for example, six hours per workday. This approach extends the project schedule. Resource smoothing, like resource leveling, flattens the amount of time a worker can work on tasks, but is usually only done on activities that are not on the critical path. This approach extends the project schedule. This is not an example of fast-tracking because fast-tracking means that tasks are done in parallel.

Adding team members can be disruptive in the middle of the project.
