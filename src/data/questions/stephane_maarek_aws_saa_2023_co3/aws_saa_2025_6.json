    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nAmazon EBS provides the following volume types, which differ in performance characteristics and price so that you can tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your applications. The volumes types fall into two categories:\n\nSSD-backed volumes optimized for transactional workloads involving frequent read/write operations with small I/O size, where the dominant performance attribute is IOPS\n\nHDD-backed volumes optimized for large streaming workloads where throughput (measured in MiB/s) is a better performance measure than IOPS\n\nConvert the gp2 volume to an io1\n\nProvisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads, that are sensitive to storage performance and consistency. Unlike gp2, which uses a bucket and credit model to calculate performance, an io1 volume allows you to specify a consistent IOPS rate when you create the volume, and Amazon EBS delivers the provisioned performance 99.9 percent of the time.\n\nThe only solution is to convert the volume into an io1 volume. This will allow us to keep the same disk size while independently increasing the IOPS for that volume.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nStop the Amazon CloudWatch agent to improve performance - The Amazon CloudWatch agent does not have any impact on the performance of the instance.\n\nIncrease the IOPS on the gp2 volume - General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for a broad range of workloads.

Message brokers allow different software systems–often using different programming languages, and on different platforms–to communicate and exchange information. If an organization is using messaging with existing applications and wants to move the messaging service to the cloud quickly and easily, AWS recommends Amazon MQ for such a use case. So this is the correct option.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nAmazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) - Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Amazon SNS provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. SNS does not provide support for migration from RabbitMQ as its a fully managed pub/sub messaging service. Hence this option is incorrect.\n\nAmazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) Standard - Amazon SQS Standard offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. Amazon SQS lets you easily move data between distributed application components and helps you build applications in which messages are processed independently (with message-level ack/fail semantics), such as automated workflows. SQS Standard does not provide support for migration from RabbitMQ. Hence this option is incorrect.\n\nAmazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) - Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) has all the capabilities of the standard queue. They are used when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated. SQS FIFO does not provide support for migration from RabbitMQ.

    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nAmazon EFS file systems are distributed across an unconstrained number of storage servers. This distributed data storage design enables file systems to grow elastically to petabyte scale. It also enables massively parallel access from compute instances, including Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, and AWS Lambda, to your data.\n\nUse Amazon EFS with Provisioned Throughput mode\n\nProvisioned Throughput mode is available for applications with high throughput to storage (MiB/s per TiB) ratios, or with requirements greater than those allowed by the Bursting Throughput mode. For example, say you're using Amazon EFS for development tools, web serving, or content management applications where the amount of data in your file system is low relative to throughput demands. Your file system can now get the high levels of throughput your applications require without having to pad your file system.\n\nIf your file system is in the Provisioned Throughput mode, you can increase the Provisioned Throughput of your file system as often as you want. You can decrease your file system throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode as long as it's been more than 24 hours since the last decrease. Additionally, you can change between Provisioned Throughput mode and the default Bursting Throughput mode as long as it’s been more than 24 hours since the last throughput mode change.\n\n via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nUse Amazon EFS with Bursting Throughput mode - With Bursting Throughput mode, a file system's throughput scales as the amount of data stored in the standard storage class grows. File-based workloads are typically spiky, driving high levels of throughput for short periods of time, and low levels of throughput the rest of the time. To accommodate this, Amazon EFS is designed to burst to high throughput levels for periods of time. By default, AWS recommends that you run your application in the Bursting Throughput mode. But, if you're planning to migrate large amounts of data into your file system, consider switching to Provisioned Throughput mode.\n\nThe use-case mentions that the solution should be optimized for high-frequency reading and writing even when the old outputs are archived, therefore Provisioned Throughput mode is a better fit as it guarantees high levels of throughput your applications require without having to pad your file system.\n\nUse an Amazon EBS volume mounted to the Amazon ECS cluster instances - Amazon EFS has a higher throughput than Amazon EBS. In addition, Amazon EBS can be attached to multiple Amazon EC2 instances when the underlying EBS type is io1/io2 and the instance is of Nitro type. The use-case does not provide any such details, so this option is ruled out.\n\nUse Amazon DynamoDB table that is accessible by all ECS cluster instances - Amazon DynamoDB is not a fit for this scenario as each task output is 20 MB but the storage limit for each item in a Amazon DynamoDB table is 400 KB. You could write custom code to split the task output data into multiple items but it is not an optimal solution compared to using Amazon EFS in Provisioned Throughput mode.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html#limits-items",

For example, say you're using Amazon EFS for development tools, web serving, or content management applications where the amount of data in your file system is low relative to throughput demands. Your file system can now get the high levels of throughput your applications require without having to pad your file system."

        "answer": "",
        "explanation": "If your file system is in the Provisioned Throughput mode, you can increase the Provisioned Throughput of your file system as often as you want. You can decrease your file system throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode as long as it's been more than 24 hours since the last decrease. Additionally, you can change between Provisioned Throughput mode and the default Bursting Throughput mode as long as it’s been more than 24 hours since the last throughput mode change."

        "answer": "",
        "explanation": "<strong>Use Amazon EFS with Bursting Throughput mode</strong> - With Bursting Throughput mode, a file system's throughput scales as the amount of data stored in the standard storage class grows. File-based workloads are typically spiky, driving high levels of throughput for short periods of time, and low levels of throughput the rest of the time. To accommodate this, Amazon EFS is designed to burst to high throughput levels for periods of time. By default, AWS recommends that you run your application in the Bursting Throughput mode. But, if you're planning to migrate large amounts of data into your file system, consider switching to Provisioned Throughput mode."

        "answer": "",
        "explanation": "The use-case mentions that the solution should be optimized for high-frequency reading and writing even when the old outputs are archived, therefore Provisioned Throughput mode is a better fit as it guarantees high levels of throughput your applications require without having to pad your file system."

        "answer": "",
        "explanation": "<strong>Use an Amazon EBS volume mounted to the Amazon ECS cluster instances</strong> - Amazon EFS has a higher throughput than Amazon EBS. In addition, Amazon EBS can be attached to multiple Amazon EC2 instances when the underlying EBS type is io1/io2 and the instance is of Nitro type. The use-case does not provide any such details, so this option is ruled out."

You could write custom code to split the task output data into multiple items but it is not an optimal solution compared to using Amazon EFS in Provisioned Throughput mode."

Amazon S3 Standard-IA offers high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance makes S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files. The minimum storage duration charge is 30 days.\n\nAnalyze the cold data with Amazon Athena\n\nAmazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage, and customers pay only for the queries they run. You can use Amazon Athena to process logs, perform ad-hoc analysis, and run interactive queries.\n\nMoving the data to Amazon S3 glacier will prevent us from being able to query it. Therefore, we should migrate the data to Amazon S3 Standard IA and use Amazon Athena to analyze the cold data.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nMigrate the Amazon Redshift underlying storage to Amazon S3 IA - Amazon Redshift is a fully-managed petabyte-scale cloud-based data warehouse product designed for large scale data set storage and analysis.

Each cluster runs an Amazon Redshift engine and contains one or more databases. An Amazon Redshift cluster consists of nodes. Each cluster has a leader node and one or more compute nodes. The leader node receives queries from client applications, parses the queries, and develops query execution plans. The leader node then coordinates the parallel execution of these plans with the compute nodes and aggregates the intermediate results from these nodes. It then finally returns the results to the client applications.\n\nRedshift's internal storage does not have \"tiers\" of storage classes like Amazon S3, so this option is also ruled out.\n\nCreate a smaller Amazon Redshift Cluster with the cold data - Creating a smaller cluster with the cold data would not decrease the storage cost of Amazon Redshift, which will only increase with time as we keep on creating data. Therefore this option is ruled out.\n\nMove the data to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 30 days - Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (GDA) is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 cloud storage class for data archiving and long-term backup. It is designed to deliver 99.999999999% durability, and provide comprehensive security and compliance capabilities that can help meet even the most stringent regulatory requirements.

    "explanation": "Correct option:\n\nAmazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) temporary queues\n\nTemporary queues help you save development time and deployment costs when using common message patterns such as request-response. You can use the Temporary Queue Client to create high-throughput, cost-effective, application-managed temporary queues.\n\nThe client maps multiple temporary queues—application-managed queues created on demand for a particular process—onto a single Amazon SQS queue automatically. This allows your application to make fewer API calls and have a higher throughput when the traffic to each temporary queue is low. When a temporary queue is no longer in use, the client cleans up the temporary queue automatically, even if some processes that use the client aren't shut down cleanly.\n\nThe following are the benefits of temporary queues:\n\nThey serve as lightweight communication channels for specific threads or processes.\n\nThey can be created and deleted without incurring additional costs.\n\nThey are API-compatible with static (normal) Amazon SQS queues. This means that existing code that sends and receives messages can send messages to and receive messages from virtual queues.\n\nTo better support short-lived, lightweight messaging destinations, AWS recommends Amazon SQS Temporary Queue Client. This client makes it easy to create and delete many temporary messaging destinations without inflating your AWS bill. The key concept behind the client is the virtual queue. Virtual queues let you multiplex many low-traffic queues onto a single Amazon SQS queue. Creating a virtual queue only instantiates a local buffer to hold messages for consumers as they arrive; there is no API call to SQS and no costs associated with creating a virtual queue.\n\nEnd-to-end process for sending messages through virtual queues: \n via - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/simple-two-way-messaging-using-the-amazon-sqs-temporary-queue-client/\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nAmazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) dead-letter queues - Amazon SQS supports dead-letter queues, which other queues (source queues) can target for messages that can't be processed (consumed) successfully. Dead-letter queues are useful for debugging your application or messaging system because they let you isolate problematic messages to determine why their processing doesn't succeed. Amazon SQS does not create the dead-letter queue automatically. You must first create the queue before using it as a dead-letter queue.\n\nAmazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues - Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated. FIFO queues also provide exactly-once processing but have a limited number of transactions per second (TPS).\n\nAmazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) delay queues - Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for a number of seconds, for example, when your consumer application needs additional time to process messages. If you create a delay queue, any messages that you send to the queue remain invisible to consumers for the duration of the delay period. The default (minimum) delay for a queue is 0 seconds. The maximum is 15 minutes.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-temporary-queues.html\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/simple-two-way-messaging-using-the-amazon-sqs-temporary-queue-client/",

This client makes it easy to create and delete many temporary messaging destinations without inflating your AWS bill. The key concept behind the client is the virtual queue. Virtual queues let you multiplex many low-traffic queues onto a single Amazon SQS queue. Creating a virtual queue only instantiates a local buffer to hold messages for consumers as they arrive; there is no API call to SQS and no costs associated with creating a virtual queue."

When using partition placement groups, Amazon EC2 divides each group into logical segments called partitions. Amazon EC2 ensures that each partition within a placement group has its own set of racks. Each rack has its own network and power source. No two partitions within a placement group share the same racks, allowing you to isolate the impact of a hardware failure within your application.\n\nThe following image is a simple visual representation of a partition placement group in a single Availability Zone. It shows instances that are placed into a partition placement group with three partitions—Partition 1, Partition 2, and Partition 3. Each partition comprises multiple instances. The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in the other partitions, allowing you to contain the impact of a single hardware failure to only the associated partition.\n\nPartition placement groups can be used to deploy large distributed and replicated workloads, such as HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra, across distinct racks. When you launch instances into a partition placement group, Amazon EC2 tries to distribute the instances evenly across the number of partitions that you specify. You can also launch instances into a specific partition to have more control over where the instances are placed.\n\nA partition placement group can have partitions in multiple Availability Zones in the same Region.

Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both.

Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other. Launching instances in a spread placement group reduces the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same racks. Spread placement groups provide access to distinct racks, and are therefore suitable for mixing instance types or launching instances over time.

Amazon SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. Amazon SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.\n\nUsing Amazon SQS as a middleware will help us sustain the write throughput during write peaks and therefore this option is the best fit for the given use-case.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nAmazon DynamoDB DAX - Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement – from milliseconds to microseconds – even at millions of requests per second. DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables, without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation, data population, or cluster management.\n\nDAX is used for caching reads, not to help with writes. So this option is ruled out.\n\nAmazon Kinesis Data Streams - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events. The throughput of an Amazon Kinesis data stream is designed to scale without limits via increasing the number of shards within a data stream. Kinesis is used to process consistent real-time data and does not scale as cost effectively as SQS to handle spikes in traffic.\n\nAmazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) - Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Amazon SNS won't keep our data if it cannot be delivered, so this option is incorrect.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/faqs/",

Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) and use encryption context to generate a different key for each file/object that you store in the S3 bucket - An encryption context is a set of key-value pairs that contain additional contextual information about the data.

Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) to encrypt the data</strong> - Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) is the easiest way to implement the given requirement, as there is no additional overhead of splitting data. Multiple S3 buckets are redundant for this requirement."

        "explanation": "<strong>Use Multi-Region keys for client-side encryption in the AWS S3 Encryption Client to generate unique keys for each file of data</strong> - Server-side encryption is the encryption of data at its destination by the application or service that receives it. The requirement is about server-side encryption and not about client-side encryption, hence this choice is incorrect."

Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) and use encryption context to generate a different key for each file/object that you store in the S3 bucket</strong> - An encryption context is a set of key-value pairs that contain additional contextual information about the data. When an encryption context is specified for an encryption operation, Amazon S3 must specify the same encryption context for the decryption operation. The encryption context offers another level of security for the encryption key. However, it is not useful for generating unique keys."
