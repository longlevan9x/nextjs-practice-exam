Clarify tasks and processes, not just goals and roles, is ideal for any project, but the problem in this question centers on effective communication, trust, and teamwork. A team charter is needed in agile projects, but there is little evidence this is an agile project. In addition, a charter is not going to foster the needed trust and transparency the team needs to feel able to communicate with one another.

However, there is almost always a debilitating bug discovered shortly after a release. This escaped defect happens even though the team is not pressed for time, has a good rapport with the stakeholders, and is very familiar with the software's use cases. Since the software is used internally by a small group of experienced users, the bugs are quickly identified and diagnosed, but work that relies on the software is often delayed. Jill has tried to protect her team member's time as much as possible by canceling meetings and taking some of her team's assignments, but her team continues to deliver careless work. Jill thinks that her team needs additional training. On which competency should the team training focus?",

The sloppy nature of the team's work suggests that there is a disconnect between what is expected and what is produced. Escaped defects are defects that make it all the way to production, as in this case, add a cost of poor quality. Managing risk is appropriate for preventing surprises, but there are unlikely to be many in this case. Managing cost is not the key issue of concern with the escaped defect.

    "explanation": "An agile time and materials contract allows the customer to terminate the contract at any time on the project if they do not see any added value. With the time and materials contract in agile, the onus falls to the vendor to regularly deliver value all through the project. Because software development and testing are done in short iterations (two to four weeks), the vendor will always have value to show for the money spent—an iteration of the project. Iterating over small timeframes works if the customer is clear (at the start of a sprint) regarding the most valuable features the vendor can deliver in that time. Therefore, if the customer believes that they do not see any added value after a certain number of iterations, they can terminate the contract. The vendor gets paid for the product/service delivered until that iteration. An agile iteration contract is not a valid contract type for the Project Management Professional (PMP) exam. An agile phased development contract is not the best choice. An early termination contract is not a valid contract type.",

Demetrius has firm ideas about the project's priorities due to his long-time relationship with the stakeholders. Tanya is surprised to learn this since Demetrius seems to have significant institutional knowledge and confidence. He often says that many people on his team do not know what is going on and that others are too timid to document requirements effectively. Eventually, the stakeholders confide in Tanya, letting her know that they often find it challenging to advance ideas for features if they differ from ideas that Demetrius advocates. When they do, Demetrius is often condescending, asking if they have really thought about the consequences of their decisions. As a result, stakeholders appease Demetrius but are often dissatisfied with the project's features and consistently request revisions.

With the project being so far ahead, you should recommend that the team takes some time away from the project and have some work-life balance. While receiving a bonus for being done early is nice, most incentive-based contracts have a maximum bonus for the organization, so the time away may not affect the bonus incentive. It is important to respect the individuals on the project work and be reasonable on how much additional work one can do without affecting the quality of the project and the safety of the people completing the work. The team is already aware of why they are working overtime and this choice could be insulting to the people doing the work. This choice does not resolve the issue with the project team and their energy level. It does not take emotional intelligence to see why people are tired and this choice does not solve the problem in the scenario. More workers on the project may help the project finish faster, but it does not address the needed break from the project work. In addition, more people on the project takes time to add, might dilute the value of the incentive-based contract, and there is a learning curve the new workers will need in the project.",

    "explanation": "Pair programming essentially means that two people write code together on one machine. It is a collaborative way of working and involves a lot of communication. While a pair of developers work on a task together, they do not only write code they also plan and discuss their work. They clarify ideas, discuss approaches, and come to better solutions. This technique can also be applied to agile project teams with regard to knowledge management. This way, one developer who has faced a particular issue can educate their companion on how to best tackle and resolve it in the existing setting. Also, using pair alternation, the whole team can share information, as developers will hand over experiences to one another every time they alternate. Consequently, it surges corporate learning and retains business information. As a result, if any developer chooses to leave the project, the knowledge would be sustained with the other paired developer. Divergence means that the programmers will work separately and without interaction. Continuous integration is the concept of integrating the new code with the established code as the new code passes its test for acceptability. Test-driven development is the concept of writing the test and then writing the code to pass the test. This is an excellent approach to development, but it is not the best choice for this scenario because of the attrition rate and isolated knowledge.",
