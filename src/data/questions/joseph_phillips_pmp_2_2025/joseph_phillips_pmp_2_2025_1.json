Training is not necessarily needed, but an easy-to-navigate knowledge base is. Removing old material risks losing important information.

A self-managing team minimizes the threats of loss of fairness by having rules come from within rather than without, and mentoring can build relatedness. Status and fairness do not address or minimize threats as status is about the relative importance to others, not addressing threats to the project. Relatedness and certainty do not minimize threats as relatedness is about teamwork and community within the project, which is admirable, but does not address risks.

Examining the complaints is a tempting choice, but he should first see that the stakeholders are receiving the information they expect from the project.

A matrix structure means the project team comes from many departments or lines of business in the organization. The team may be on more than one project, and the project manager and the functional managers share authority over the project decisions and budget. A projectized structure, also called a project-centric structure, means the project team is on just one project, reports to the project manager, and the project manager has full authority over the project. A hybrid project is a custom-designed structure that can vary in each organization. For example, the organization could normally operate as a functional structure, but they will use a functional structure for a special project.",

Indirect costs are an incorrect choice because this is a cost attributed directly to the project's work. A variable cost can change in the project; the cost in this scenario is \"fixed\" at $785 per month. Parametric costs, a value used to calculate cost per use, per ton, or unit, are incorrect.

Communication will increase because the project team is dispersed when utilizing a virtual team. However, the question asks what is a benefit of utilizing a collocated team, so this choice is not applicable to the scenario. A dispersed team is not automatically self-led. You can utilize a predictive, hybrid, or agile approach with virtual teams, but the non-collocation doesn’t make a team self-led. Project costs are not necessarily reduced when a team is collocated. Costs may increase in some instances due to travel expenses in bringing the team members together to complete the project.",

This project has been in the newspapers as it will promote large events in the city's downtown and bring visitors from around the world. Hotels, restaurants, and other downtown businesses are excited about the change the improvement will bring to the city. Kiera also has stakeholders from the management company of the events to be held in the center, government officials, media, the public at large, and a host of vendors. As her team works, new stakeholders are discovered depending on their work in the project. One of the most frequent complaints that she gets is from stakeholders is that they are not informed of different project aspects.&nbsp;What document should Kiera create with her team to better inform stakeholders of work that may affect them as the project moves forward?",

    "explanation": "Kiera needs a detailed communications management plan that should address who needs what information,  when it is needed, and the expected modality. If stakeholders are not aware of activities that may affect them in this project, then communication is failing – likely because the plan does not include a schedule and triggers to alert the affected stakeholders before the work begins. A RACI matrix uses the legend of Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. It is a matrix that maps out the assignments and accountability. The stakeholder engagement plan is not the best choice as the problem in this scenario is communication, not engagement. Stakeholders are generally excited about the project, but not about the poor communication in the project. An information radiator is a public posting of project progress and is generally used in agile projects.",
