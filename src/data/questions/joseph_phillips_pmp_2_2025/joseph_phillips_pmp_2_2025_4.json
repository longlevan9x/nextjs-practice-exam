Letting the resource decide which task to work on is not the best choice as the teams are in conflict over the order of tasks to be completed.

Therefore, schedule, price, and risk should be negotiated after the scope. The schedule is not the first item to be negotiated, but the project scope must be determined to predict the project work duration. Price is based on the requirements of the project, which are defined in the project scope. Risk is often negotiated as it relates to its effect on time and cost, but the items in the requirements, the project scope, have a direct bearing on the risk of the project.",

    "question": "A project manager is working on a project spanning several years. Over time, the stakeholders responsible for guiding the project's deliverables have grown from two people to ten, all with varying engagement levels and influence toward the project and the organization. The project manager observes that the group's growth makes it more challenging to know what the project is meant to deliver, which in turn increases the likelihood of scope creep, missed timelines, and budget shortfalls. Moreover, meetings with the stakeholders tend to devolve into status updates rather than ways to gather information about the attributes of the project's deliverable. As a result, the project manager decides to update the ground rules regarding stakeholder engagement. Notably, the project manager will facilitate a demonstration of the deliverables to date to ensure stakeholders' expectations align with the delivery's realities. If they do, the stakeholders will sign off on the deliverables; if not, stakeholders and the project team will develop written feedback for what needs to change, which they will likewise sign off on.

The project charter authorizes the project and the project manager and does not address the team rules. A better choice would be the team charter. The project plan defines how the project will be managed and the selected processes to be utilized. In an agile project, there is not a project plan.

Additionally, team members who speak numerous languages remove the need to hire a third party. Using another communication technology tool will not solve the root problem of this situation.

While the memo's direct purpose is to educate its recipients of the reason for the delay, the indirect goal is to prepare the recipients so that they will be more willing to increase the budget for Avon's project. Avon's team and peers are aware of the memo's contents but will not receive a copy. This is an example of what kind of communication?",

The 'Objects' portion of the AEIOU framework discusses the objects and devices people have in their environments and how they relate to their activities. The 'Interactions' portion describes the relations between people and things in their environment and across distances.

The only person who has the information needed to assess the project's viability is the product owner. The product owner is also the sole person responsible for managing the product backlog and maximizing the product's value resulting from the development team's work. Therefore, the scrum master should connect with the product owner and ask if the project is still viable to continue. The development team or the scrum master cannot re-prioritize the backlog directly without the product owner's consent. The scrum master will not prepare the team for a new project, that will come from their managers, the project sponsor, or other entities. In addition, the scrum master should first meet with the product owner to understand the situation. The scrum master cannot cancel the sprint.",
