A good leader is one that a team will listen to and respect. Taking time to grow your knowledge and skills and further developing your communication skills is vital to lead project teams and work with stakeholders. Getting away from the chaos and stress of the project is not a valid reason for additional training. The results of work and education may lead to new opportunities and better pay, but these are not the primary reasons one should attend training. Looking for new job opportunities is not a good reason to attend training.

Since meeting in a conference room is not an option, frequent video conferences or conference calls are the next best option.&nbsp;While emails are useful, they are not always the best way of communicating. A conference call or video conference with all or most of the team attending allows issues to be addressed that are harder to tackle one by one or via email.&nbsp;The challenge for Bill would be navigating the time zones to make this possible, but it is the best option to push his team and the project forward.&nbsp;Allowing each location to work independently is not feasible as project teams need to work together and rely upon each other. Daily email digests to instruct the team is not an effective method to lead or build the project team. Make phone calls to individual team members can be useful, but this segments the communication among the team members. Not everyone will receive the same message and this is not a good use of the project manager's time.",

A good deal is when both people feel like they have won and are happy. Never revealing your actual number may be good negotiating advice for some, but it is not the best choice presented. Sometimes you will need to reveal your budget to determine what you can afford from the vendor. You cannot always negotiate from a position of strength. For example, consider a small organization negotiating a sale to a large enterprise. The small organization cannot necessarily negotiate from strength in that scenario. Getting the best deal for the organization seems like a good choice, but it does not consider what is fair for the products or services the vendor is providing. The best choice is fair and equitable contract negotiations.",

When they started the project, they often worked at each others' desks to maximize real-time feedback and capture creative and functional ideas. However, the project manager recently moved and has been fully remote ever since. As they attempt to finalize the visual design, the project manager has sent many emails to the User Experience Engineer to describe how the project should look. Unfortunately, the User Experience Engineer replies to these emails with mock-ups that do not quite capture the project manager's needs.

It is especially helpful for demonstrating visual components or making contextual clues, like facial expressions, more apparent than they might otherwise be in a virtual environment. A shared repository where a team can store and share information is helpful when teams are virtual. But such repositories are mainly useful for maintaining version control so that the latest documentation or source code is always available to all team members. Email and chat options are a great way to quickly update many people efficiently or have a quick, one-off conversation with team members. Email and chat are not always appropriate for long-form communications. Audio conferencing is an excellent way to build rapport and increase confidence through spoken communication.

Ideally, you should review the contract terms with someone from the procurement office or with a legal understanding. Depending on the terms, you may tell the contractor to stop work, you might not need to issue any payment, or you may only need to issue partial payment. However, it is impossible to know what the options are until you have reviewed the contract. Telling the contractor to stop all work may be feasible after reviewing the terms of the contract. Telling the procurement office not to issue payment to the contractor likely is not a good choice as the contract terms need to be reviewed first. In addition, there may have been work completed that the organization must pay the contractor for. Issuing payment for the work provided but not for the work that has not been completed seems like an excellent choice, but the contract terms should be reviewed first.",

Tom and Jules are no longer on speaking terms. When Ji Yeung talks to Jules, she shuts the conversation down by asserting that Tom will muddy the waters if he speaks with stakeholders. When Ji Yeung explains how important it is for Tom to be in touch with the stakeholders, Jules balks and threatens to leave if Tom establishes regular contact with the stakeholders.

The project manager sees the entire project, is most familiar with organizational objectives, and can better evaluate the project's impact with the team's assistance. Asking the team members why they added the enhancements is important, but the answer will not explain how the team member knows there is no impact on the project's time, cost, or quality. Asking the business team to identify the value of the improvement is important. However, the project manager should first acquire the team member's justification for the change. Confirming that the customer is willing to incur this added expense is not necessary at this point because, according to the team member, the change did not impact the project's time, cost, or quality.",

This will help build trust and keep her stakeholders aware of what is going on in their project. Doing nothing risks the stakeholders finding out on their own, damaging Edith's relationship with them. Waiting until the next sprint review is not a good option as the stakeholders will be finding out about the incident well after it happened. A contingency reserve is used for known risks and this is an issue as the unknown risk has occurred.

Building a strong project management team is ideal for any project manager, but this choice does not address the resource management concerns. Controlling resources more strictly than if the resources were collocated is not the best choice as there is little evidence that you will need to control resources more strictly just because they are remote. Remote workers, or virtual teams, are a common project management concept and would require a different management approach than a more strict management approach.
