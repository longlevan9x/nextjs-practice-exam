During construction, one or more webcams are installed on the site, with periodic updates to a publicly available website. The progress on the project can be viewed on the Internet by all stakeholders. Video data can also be stored, allowing analysis if a claim arises. Some projects have discovered that the use of webcams minimizes disputes relating to the construction work on site, as the webcam has recorded the events, so there should be no disagreement about the facts of the matter.",
