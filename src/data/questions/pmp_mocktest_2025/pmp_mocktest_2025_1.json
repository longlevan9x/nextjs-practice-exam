    "explanation": "Alice should buy the solution as it is incredibly more cost-effective than her in-house solution. It will take 129 months, nearly 11 years, for her solution to be more cost-effective than the vendor’s solution. You can find this answer by subtracting the buy costs from the build costs, which is $650,000 - $120,000 for a difference of $530,000. Then you find the difference of the monthly support costs, which is 21,400-17,300 and equals $4,100. Then you’ll divide the monthly difference into the out-of-pocket costs: 530,000/4,100 for a solution of 129 months. This means in 129 months the in-house solution is more cost-effective than the vendor’s solution.",

An RBS helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise. This can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing the identified risks. The organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects, or there may be several RBS frameworks for different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored RBS. Where an RBS is not used, an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives.",
