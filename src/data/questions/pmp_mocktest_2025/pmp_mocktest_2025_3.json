On your exam, you may have to first find the answer with the number of stakeholders including the project manager and then find the answer without the project manager in the number. Generally, it’s assumed that the project manager is a stakeholder (of course), and you’ll include the project manager in the calculation. Basically, do the formula and see if any of the answers match your findings if not, do the formula again and make an adjustment for the project manager to be included or not.

It will take 129 months, nearly 11 years, for her solution to be more cost-effective than the vendor’s solution. You can find this answer by subtracting the buy costs from the build costs, which is $650,000 - $120,000 for a difference of $530,000. Then you find the difference of the monthly support costs, which is 21,400-17,300 and equals $4,100. Then you’ll divide the monthly difference into the out-of-pocket costs: 530,000/4,100 for a solution of 129 months.

    "question": "Gary is the project manager of the NKQ Project and he’s in a heated discussion with his team lead. The team lead has instructed the project team members to delay the start of an activity until all of the materials needed arrive on the job site. This action has caused a ripple effect of delays in the project that were not approved by Gary. The team leader’s logic was that all of the materials were not yet on the job site so that the team couldn’t complete all of the work. Gary, however, believes that the team could begin the work and the new materials would be delivered as the team consumed the materials. What type of solution was Gary working with in this scenario?",

    "explanation": "Gary was using JIT Scheduling, which is Just-in-Time scheduling. This approach provides new materials to the job site as the team consumes the current materials. It saves on space on the job site, limits cash outlays, and prevents theft of materials as the materials are only delivered as they are needed and don’t need to be stored and managed at the job site. This is not an example of float or mandatory dependencies. Note that mandatory dependencies are also known as hard logic.",
